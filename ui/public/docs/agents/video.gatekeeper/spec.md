## Folder specification (`SPEC.md`)

# GateKeeperAgent

> Self-contained VA Domain Pack agent on host common-agent-swarm-ops.
> Pack agent ID matches pure VA/generic taxonomy: `video.gatekeeper`.

## Identity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **va_id** | 57 |
| **pack_id** | `video.gatekeeper` |
| **upstream_name** | GateKeeperAgent |
| **category** | `9-Meta` |
| **domain_id** | `video` |
| **previous_common_id** | `video.signoff_coordinator` |
| **status** | `registered` |
| **maturity** | L0 / non-active |
| **taxonomy** | Pure VA Domain Pack (via generic pack agents) |
| **folder** | `business/video/agents/video.gatekeeper/` |

## Responsibility

Phase transitions; verifies L1/L2/L3 criteria; signs C2PA

Host role binding: `GateKeeperAgent (VA Domain Pack)`. Design-time VA table content below is historical and non-binding for activation.

### Responsibility (from VA table)

Phase transitions; verifies L1/L2/L3 criteria; signs C2PA

### Knowledge distillation sources (historical)

Stage-gate methodology; PGA Producers Mark; QMS audit

### Self-quality criteria (historical)

Zero leaked defects; sign-off SLA ≥99%

### Surpass-human signal (historical)

Lower escaped-defect rate than human QA lead

### Critique bus (historical)

- **Accepts critique from:** ComplianceAgent, AIQAConsistencyAgent

- **Comments on:** OrchestratorAgent (premature advance)

### Tools design-time notes (historical, non-activating)

C2PA signing (c2patool); JSON schema validators; rubric evaluation endpoints

**Runtime safety:** Host allow-lists are only `agent_spec.json` + `tool-permission-register.json`. CI uses video_* stubs. Do not treat design-time vendor names as enabled APIs.

### Architecture pattern (historical)

Constitutional AI (constitution = phase-gate criteria)

## Boundaries and escalation

- Fail-closed: no provider activation, no network, no credentials from design text.
- `production_activation_requested` remains false unless a separate human gate changes it.
- Escalates legal, safety, rights, and release decisions to required human gates.
- Critique lead / judge defaults use VA IDs `video.critic` and `video.judge`.

## Inputs and outputs

- Inputs: local pack artifacts and typed handoffs.
- Outputs: reviewable video-domain deliverables with acceptance criteria.
- Acceptance: host policy plus local SPEC criteria; no external repository required.

## Quality and critique

- Prompt reference: `video.prompt.gatekeeper.v1`
- Rubric reference: `video.rubric.gatekeeper.v1`
- Critique edges: `{"inputs": ["video.critic"], "outputs": ["video.judge"]}`
- Max refinement: `3`
- VA table quality criteria retained under Provenance and Identity surface above.

Common structure of an AI agent (full §11 from agents.md)

11. Common Structure of an AI Agent

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |
| 13 | **Critique Outbox** | Peer agents whose work this agent is qualified to review | Defined per-agent in roster. Messages emitted on same bus. Evidence-backed, rubric-referenced, appended to C2PA provenance. |
| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

**Deep Intent Analysis Framework (DIA) v2.0**  
**Comprehensive Functional Specification Document**

**Version:** 2.0 (Research-Enhanced)  
**Date:** May 26, 2026  
**Status:** Complete Functional Specification  
**Basis:** Original 6-phase DIA (from conversation history) + deep integration of 2025–2026 arXiv research on computational pragmatics, speech act theory, LLM-based intent/implicature reasoning, multi-party discourse analysis, and xAI Grok capabilities.

---

1. Executive Summary

The **Deep Intent Analysis Framework (DIA) v2.0** is a complete, production-ready, modular system for systematically decoding any text’s **purpose**, **hidden agenda**, **multi-angle perspectives**, **illocutionary force**, and **ethical/behavioral quality**.  

It transforms the original 6-phase manual/LLM-prompt pipeline into a **fully specified, agentic, evaluable software system** built on xAI’s Grok-4.3 (or latest) with native tool use, 1M+ token context, structured outputs, and low-hallucination reasoning.

**Core Objectives**  
- Answer: *Why does this language exist? What is the real goal? What is hidden? How many angles exist? Is the behavior good/wrong/effective?*  
- Achieve human-expert-level pragmatic reasoning at scale.  
- Support manual use, API, web app, IDE plugin, and enterprise analytics.

**Key v2.0 Improvements (from arXiv + xAI research)**  
- **Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC)** integration for superior implicature & hidden-agenda detection.  
- **Multi-Perspective Agent Simulation** (inspired by multi-party conversational agents survey) for richer angle mapping.  
- **Gricean + Extended Maxims** (including Benevolence & Transparency for AI contexts).  
- **Automated Speech Act / Dialog Act Classification** using recent taxonomies and LLM judges.  
- **Hybrid Evaluation Pipeline** (automatic metrics + human-in-the-loop).  
- **Native xAI Integration**: Grok-4.3 reasoning modes, tool calling, real-time search for context validation.

**Target Users**  
Journalists, analysts, researchers, educators, content moderators, legal teams, AI safety engineers, and power users who want to “see through” language.

---

2. Background, Motivation & Research Foundation

**Original Motivation (from user history)**  
Language serves communication, but always with purpose, hidden intent, multiple angles, and moral implications. The 6-phase DIA provides a repeatable algorithm.

**2025–2026 Research Integration** (selected key sources)

- **Pragmatics in the Era of LLMs Survey** (arXiv:2502.12378): Comprehensive datasets for speech acts, implicature, social pragmatics; highlights LLM gaps in deeper pragmatic reasoning and English-centric bias. Recommends hybrid evaluation and theory-grounded prompting.

- **Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC)** (arXiv:2503.01539): 4-step relevance-theory-based prompting dramatically improves implicit toxicity / hidden bias detection (GPT-4o: +12.26 pp). Explicitly separates literal meaning, metaphors, norm violation, and judgment. Directly enhances Phase 3 & 4.

- **Multi-Party Conversational Agents Survey** (arXiv:2505.18845): State-of-Mind taxonomy (Emotion, Engagement, Personality Big-Five, Dialog Acts); discourse structure; Theory of Mind (ToM) for multi-perspective modeling. Enables true multi-angle simulation.

- **Gricean Maxims in NLP & Human-AI Interaction**: Multiple papers extend Grice with Benevolence & Transparency maxims for AI; use maxim-violation detection for offensive/hidden-agenda texts.

- **xAI / Grok Research**: Grok-4.3 excels at agentic tool use, long-context reasoning, low hallucination, and social role mediation (truth arbiter, adversary). Ideal backbone for DIA as a trustworthy, multi-role analysis agent.

These findings directly upgrade the original framework into a **scientifically grounded, computationally implementable specification**.

---

4. Detailed Functional Requirements – 6 Phases (v2.0 Enhanced)

Phase 0: Context Analyzer
**Inputs**: Raw text, optional metadata (sender, platform, date, prior messages).  
**Processing**: LLM extracts sender power/relationship, audience, medium norms, trigger event; bias self-check prompt.  
**Enhancement**: Real-time search tool for historical/cultural context.  
**Output**: Structured context object + confidence.

Phase 1: Purpose Categorization (Jakobson Functions)
**Table** (unchanged but now LLM-ranked with evidence): Referential, Emotive, Conative, Phatic, Metalingual, Poetic.  
**v2.0**: Multi-label classification with probability distribution + justification.

Phase 2: Surface Literal Analysis
**Checklist** (facts vs opinions, loaded words, voice, omissions, ambiguity).  
**Enhancement**: Embedding-based vagueness scoring + coreference resolution.

Phase 3: Pragmatic & Speech Act Engine (Core Upgrade)
**Components**:
- **Searle’s 5 Categories** (Assertives, Directives, Commissives, Expressives, Declaratives) + fine-grained taxonomies from Parliamentary Debates & CyberAgressionAdo-v2 (“attack”, “defend”, etc.).
- **Grice Maxim Violation Detector**: Automated scoring (Quantity, Quality, Relation, Manner) + extended maxims (Benevolence, Transparency).
- **PIC Integration** (mandatory for hidden agenda):
  1. Explain metaphors/special meanings (layperson language).
  2. Literal meaning (layperson language).
  3. Identify contradictions with relevant social/ethical norms (equality, truth-seeking, non-manipulation, etc.).
  4. Final implicature judgment.

**Output per utterance**: `{illocutionary_act, perlocutionary_effect, maxim_violations: [...], implicature: "...", confidence}`

Phase 4: Hidden Agenda & Multi-Angle Dissection (Major Upgrade)
**Steps**:
1. Explicit vs Implicit goals (power, status, division, validation…).
2. Power & ideology scan (CDA-style: who benefits? us vs them?).
3. **Multi-Perspective Agent Simulation** (new): Spawn 4–6 parallel Grok agents, each embodying one POV (speaker, receiver, opponent, society, historical, environmental). Each produces angle summary + evidence. Aggregate with clustering.
4. Framing analysis + inconsistency detection.
5. Agenda Type classification (Inform / Persuade / Manipulate / Bond / Signal / Deceive) with sub-scores.

**Output**: `hidden_agenda: str, angle_count: int, angles: [{perspective, framing, evidence}], ignored_angles: [...]`

Phase 5: Behavioral Judgment Engine
**6 Core Dimensions** (1–10 or 0–1) + 2 new:
1. Truthfulness
2. Ethical Impact (harm, autonomy, power imbalance)
3. Effectiveness (stated + hidden goals)
4. Clarity & Cooperation (Grice)
5. Social Value (understanding vs division)
6. Transparency
7. **Benevolence** (new – AI-specific)
8. **Cultural Appropriateness** (new – from multi-task pragmatic models)

**Final Verdict**: Categorical + narrative + recommended action.  
**Rule**: All scores must cite evidence from Phases 0–4.

Phase 6: Synthesis
One-paragraph executive summary + actionable recommendations + confidence vector.  
Optional: Counter-argument generator or “how to respond” module.

6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: <15s for <5k token text on Grok-4.3 high reasoning; parallel phase execution.  
- **Scalability**: Stateless API; batch mode for enterprise (1000s of texts).  
- **Accuracy**: Target >85% agreement with expert linguists on speech act + implicature benchmarks (use Parliamentary Debates, PIC test sets, etc.).  
- **Explainability**: Every claim has evidence span + confidence.  
- **Ethics & Safety**: Built-in refusal for harmful misuse; bias auditing; xAI alignment principles (truth-seeking, helpfulness without sycophancy).  
- **Privacy**: Optional local mode; no persistent storage of user texts unless opted in.

---

7. Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4)**: Prompt-engineered prototype on Grok-4.3 (all 6 phases + PIC + basic multi-agent). Structured output validation.  
**Phase 2 (Months 2–3)**: Fine-tune lightweight speech act classifier on public datasets; integrate classical NLP metrics.  
**Phase 3 (Months 4–6)**: Full agentic orchestration, web UI, API, benchmark suite (accuracy, latency, user studies).  
**Phase 4 (Ongoing)**: Continuous evaluation on new pragmatic datasets; community benchmark contribution.

**Technology Stack**  
- Backend: Python + xAI SDK + LangGraph / custom agents  
- Frontend: Streamlit / Next.js  
- Storage: PostgreSQL + Qdrant (vector)  
- Evaluation: Custom harness using arXiv pragmatic datasets

---

8. Evaluation Framework

- **Automatic**: F1 on speech act datasets, PIC accuracy lift, Grice violation detection correlation with human labels.  
- **Human**: Expert linguist agreement (Cohen’s κ > 0.75 target).  
- **A/B Testing**: DIA vs baseline LLM on real-world texts (news, ads, political speech, X posts).  
- **xAI-Specific**: Measure reduction in sycophancy / hallucination in judgment phase.

---

9. Limitations & Future Work

**Current Limitations**  
- English-dominant (mitigate with multilingual PIC prompts).  
- Requires high-quality context for best results.  
- Computational cost on very long documents (mitigated by 1M context + summarization agents).

**Future**  
- Multimodal extension (video/audio discourse).  
- Real-time conversation monitoring (multi-party).  
- Fine-tuned DIA-specialist model on xAI infrastructure.  
- Open-source benchmark suite contribution to arXiv community.

Complete Research-Hardened Specification & Design Document

**Version:** 2.1 — Research-Hardened, Security-Operationalized  
**Date:** 2026-06-03  
**Status:** Production-Ready Design Spec  
**Primary Goal:** Convert very large software-specification corpora into high-fidelity, traceable, component-type-adaptive implementation plans and granular tasks for AI coding agents and human developers.

Change Summary — v2.0 → v2.1

This revision is a deep-research pass and adversarial “100x rethink” consolidation. It does **not** merely expand the previous document; it tightens the system into an implementable, governable, security-aware planner.

Major Improvements

1. **Research verification and correction**
   - Verified MAAD as arXiv:2606.01385, submitted May 31, 2026, and preserved it as the core architecture-planning influence. ([arxiv.org]([historical-url]
   - Updated AgentOrchestra reference: current arXiv title emphasizes the Tool-Environment-Agent, or TEA, protocol and lifecycle-aware orchestration rather than only “general-purpose task solving.” ([arxiv.org]([historical-url]
   - Updated GitHub Spec Kit alignment to include the current Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement flow plus newer practical commands such as constitution, clarify, analyze, checklist, and task-to-issues. ([github.github.com]([historical-url]
   - Qualified xAI/Grok Build claims: official xAI pages verify plan mode, parallel subagents, skills/plugins/hooks/MCP, headless mode, and API availability; this spec no longer references unofficial “Arena Mode” claims and instead defines SIPA’s own optional local “Arena Evaluator.” ([x.ai]([historical-url]

2. **Added security and trust model**
   - Added prompt-injection, memory-poisoning, MCP/tool safety, least-privilege execution, untrusted-context boundaries, and human approval controls.
   - Integrated NCSC guidance that LLMs do not enforce a hard data/instruction boundary and should be treated as “inherently confusable” components. ([ncsc.gov.uk]([historical-url]
   - Integrated MCP security principles around user consent, tool safety, data privacy, and untrusted tool descriptions. ([modelcontextprotocol.io]([historical-url]
   - Added OWASP GenAI/agentic risk alignment and operational monitoring requirements. ([genai.owasp.org]([historical-url]

3. **Strengthened context engineering**
   - Formalized SIPA’s context pipeline around **write, select, compress, isolate**, matching current agent context-engineering practice. ([langchain.com]([historical-url]
   - Added retrieval budgets, evidence ledgers, source confidence levels, retrieval evaluation, and stale-source detection.
   - Added optional GraphRAG-style global/local retrieval for corpus-wide sensemaking and dependency impact analysis. ([microsoft.com]([historical-url]

4. **Expanded component taxonomy**
   - Added Security/Compliance, Testing/Quality, Migration/Legacy, AI/Agent Workflow, and Documentation/Developer Experience component types.
   - Added secondary risk tags that directly change retrieval depth, critic rubrics, and human-review requirements.

5. **Made outputs more machine-consumable**
   - Added artifact manifests, evidence ledgers, decision logs, task execution contracts, and canonical schemas.
   - Added stable IDs for requirements, claims, decisions, interfaces, tasks, risks, and open questions.

6. **Added evaluation science**
   - Added retrieval metrics, plan-quality metrics, artifact-level critic thresholds, and downstream coder-agent success metrics.
   - Integrated RAG evaluation dimensions such as context relevance, answer faithfulness, answer relevance, context precision, and context recall. ([aclanthology.org]([historical-url]

7. **Improved implementation roadmap**
   - Split MVP into a safer vertical slice.
   - Added CLI/API/MCP deployment model, observability, cache strategy, sandbox strategy, and governance gates.

1. Executive Summary

SIPA is a hierarchical, context-engineered, multi-agent planning system for turning large software specification corpora into implementation-ready plans and tasks.

It is designed for projects where the source material may include:

- Markdown specs
- PRDs
- architecture notes
- API contracts
- user stories
- domain models
- UI descriptions
- ADRs
- implementation notes
- test plans
- legacy migration notes
- operational constraints

The key idea is simple but powerful:

> **Different software components require different levels and types of detail.**

A strategic architecture plan should not be generated with the same retrieval scope, summarization style, or output format as a UI screen, a shared library, a data model, or a migration adapter.

SIPA therefore uses:

- **Component-type classification**
- **Scoped retrieval**
- **Evidence-based synthesis**
- **Hierarchical memory**
- **Embedded critic loops**
- **Traceability-first artifacts**
- **Granular task generation**
- **Security-aware agent execution**

The result is a planner that reduces context size for downstream coding agents while improving fidelity, traceability, and implementation success.

---

2. Core Problem

Large software specs break AI coding workflows in predictable ways:

1. **Context overload**
   - Too much raw documentation causes distraction, contradiction, and missed details.

2. **Uniform summarization failure**
   - Architecture needs synthesis.
   - UI features need exhaustive local detail.
   - Shared components need contracts.
   - Data models need invariants.
   - Integrations need error semantics and compatibility rules.

3. **Loss of traceability**
   - Coding agents often implement plausible behavior that is not grounded in the source spec.

4. **Weak plan-to-task translation**
   - Large plans often become vague tasks.
   - Vague tasks create bad code, rework, and hidden assumptions.

5. **Security and tool-risk amplification**
   - Agentic coding tools can read files, run commands, call APIs, and modify repos.
   - Prompt injection, over-permissioned tools, and memory poisoning become architectural risks, not just prompt risks.

SIPA exists to solve these problems before coding begins.

---

3. Research Foundation

3.1 Spec-Driven Development

GitHub Spec Kit treats specifications as the center of AI-assisted development and ships a core flow of **Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement**. It also provides Markdown artifacts, quality checklists, and cross-artifact analysis, making it a strong workflow model for SIPA’s output structure. ([github.github.com]([historical-url]

SIPA extends this model for **pre-existing massive corpora**, not just greenfield features. It adds corpus indexing, type-aware planning, traceability enforcement, and critic loops.

3.2 MAAD and Requirements-to-Architecture Planning

MAAD proposes four specialized agents — Analyst, Modeler, Designer, and Evaluator — to convert requirements into multi-view architectural blueprints with quality assessments. It uses RAG for architecture standards and patterns, hierarchical memory for design history, and an evaluator for structured quality reports. ([arxiv.org]([historical-url]

SIPA adopts MAAD most directly for the Architecture Sub-Planner, then generalizes the same analyst/designer/evaluator structure across other component types.

3.3 Hierarchical Multi-Agent Orchestration

AgentOrchestra’s current formulation introduces TEA, a Tool-Environment-Agent protocol that treats agents, tools, environments, prompts, memory, and outputs as versioned lifecycle-managed resources. It also uses a central planner coordinating specialized sub-agents. ([arxiv.org]([historical-url]

SIPA adopts the practical lesson: orchestration should not be “agents chatting.” It should be explicit state, typed handoffs, versioned artifacts, and lifecycle-aware execution.

3.4 Multi-Agent Software Engineering Patterns

The LLM-based multi-agent systems survey identifies role specialization, SDLC coverage, agent synergy, and trustworthy autonomous software engineering as major research directions. ([arxiv.org]([historical-url]

MASAI shows the value of modular sub-agents with separate objectives and strategies for software-engineering tasks, including avoiding unnecessarily long trajectories and excessive context. ([arxiv.org]([historical-url]

SWE-agent demonstrates that the interface between agent and computer materially affects coding-agent performance, motivating SIPA’s emphasis on harness-native task packaging. ([arxiv.org]([historical-url]

SWE-Search supports the value of self-evaluation and iterative refinement for repository-level software tasks. ([proceedings.iclr.cc]([historical-url]

3.5 Context Engineering

Modern agent design increasingly treats context engineering as a first-class discipline. LangChain’s current framework groups context strategies into **write, select, compress, and isolate**, which SIPA adopts as its core context model. ([langchain.com]([historical-url]

SIPA applies this as follows:

- **Write:** Persist plans, decisions, summaries, memory, and evidence outside the prompt.
- **Select:** Retrieve only the task-relevant source chunks, patterns, and memories.
- **Compress:** Summarize and extract with source-preserving compression.
- **Isolate:** Give each sub-planner a scoped context window rather than the entire corpus.

3.6 GraphRAG and Corpus Sensemaking

GraphRAG combines text extraction, network analysis, LLM prompting, and summarization to understand text datasets. Microsoft’s GraphRAG project is especially relevant for corpus-wide themes and dependency discovery. ([microsoft.com]([historical-url]

SIPA uses graph retrieval optionally, but the architecture is designed so a simpler hybrid vector/BM25 retriever can be used first.

3.7 Architecture Standards

SIPA’s architecture outputs are aligned with:

- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010** concepts of stakeholders, concerns, viewpoints, and views. ([iso-architecture.org]([historical-url]
- **C4 model** levels: system context, container, component, and code, with an emphasis on only producing diagrams that add value. ([c4model.com]([historical-url]
- **ATAM** for reasoning about quality-attribute tradeoffs and architectural risks. ([sei.cmu.edu]([historical-url]
- **Kruchten 4+1 views** for multi-perspective architecture description. ([scirp.org]([historical-url]

3.8 Security Research and Agentic Risk

NCSC warns that current LLMs do not enforce a true boundary between data and instructions, so prompt injection should be treated as an inherent residual risk that must be reduced through system design and impact limitation. ([ncsc.gov.uk]([historical-url]

OWASP’s GenAI exploit reporting shows AI security incidents are increasingly targeting agent identities, orchestration layers, supply chains, permissions, and validation controls rather than only model outputs. ([genai.owasp.org]([historical-url]

The MCP specification explicitly notes that MCP enables arbitrary data access and code execution paths, requiring user consent, data privacy controls, and caution around tool behavior descriptions. ([modelcontextprotocol.io]([historical-url]

SIPA therefore treats security as a core subsystem, not a postscript.

4. Design Principles

1. **Type-aware planning**
   - Every component gets the planning style it actually needs.

2. **Traceability before creativity**
   - SIPA may synthesize, but every major claim must be grounded in source evidence or explicitly marked as an assumption.

3. **Small context, high signal**
   - Never feed the full corpus to a sub-planner unless the task is corpus-level analysis.

4. **Critic-first quality culture**
   - Drafts are not final until they pass structured quality gates.

5. **Living specifications**
   - Plans are versioned, diffable, and updated as implementation changes.

6. **Harness-native outputs**
   - Outputs must be directly useful to Cursor, Claude Code, Kiro, Grok Build, OpenWebUI, custom CLI agents, or human developers.

7. **Security by architecture**
   - Tool access, memory, retrieval, source trust, and approval flows must be explicitly governed.

8. **Human gates where risk is high**
   - Human review is noted for strategic, security-critical, destructive, or high-cost decisions.

9. **Evaluation built in**
   - Retrieval quality, traceability, consistency, implementability, and downstream success are measured.

10. **Composable implementation**
   - SIPA can start as a CLI and later expose MCP/API integrations.

---

5. Component Taxonomy

The taxonomy controls:

- Retrieval strategy
- Context budget
- Planner selection
- Output template
- Critic rubric
- Human-review requirement
- Task decomposition style

5.1 Primary Component Types

| Type | Detail Level | Retrieval Strategy | Output Emphasis | Example |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Architecture / Strategic | High-level synthesis | Broad cross-corpus retrieval + ASRs/NFRs + patterns | Views, ADRs, tradeoffs, quality attributes | System architecture, service topology |
| Feature / UI / Tactical | Deep scoped detail | Narrow feature retrieval + full local excerpts | User stories, acceptance criteria, flows, state, validation | Dashboard, onboarding flow |
| Common / Shared Component | Contract-focused | Cross-module references + interface mentions | APIs, types, invariants, extension points | Auth service, notification library |
| Data / Domain Model | Medium | Entities, relationships, invariants, lifecycle rules | Schemas, aggregates, constraints, migrations | User, Order, Course, ExamAttempt |
| Integration / External | Medium | API contracts, event schemas, third-party docs | Mapping, retry, idempotency, compatibility | Stripe adapter, LMS sync |
| Infrastructure / DevOps | High-operational | NFRs, deployment docs, runtime constraints | IaC, CI/CD, observability, scaling | Kubernetes, GitHub Actions |
| Security / Compliance | High-rigor | Security reqs, policies, threat models, data flows | Threat model, controls, audit evidence | PII handling, RBAC, encryption |
| Testing / Quality | Medium | Acceptance criteria, test notes, defect history | Test matrix, fixtures, validation strategy | E2E suite, contract tests |
| Migration / Legacy | Medium-high | Legacy docs, current behavior, target constraints | Strangler plan, compatibility, rollback | COBOL replacement, DB migration |
| AI / Agent Workflow | High-rigor | Agent instructions, tools, memory, data access | Agent state machine, tool policy, eval harness | Coding agent, RAG assistant |
| Documentation / DevEx | Medium | Onboarding docs, workflows, developer feedback | Quickstarts, AGENTS.md, conventions | Contributor guide, module README |

5.2 Secondary Tags

Secondary tags modify critic gates and output sections:

- `security-critical`
- `privacy-sensitive`
- `performance-sensitive`
- `high-availability`
- `user-facing`
- `internal-only`
- `regulated`
- `legacy-modernization`
- `agentic-tool-use`
- `destructive-actions`
- `requires-human-review`
- `experimental`
- `mvp-critical`

5.3 Classification Rules

SIPA classifies components using:

1. Explicit metadata if present.
2. Requirement IDs and section names.
3. Keyword heuristics.
4. LLM classifier with structured output.
5. Human override.
6. Critic validation.

Classification output must include:

'''yaml
component_id: CMP-auth-service
name: Auth Service
primary_type: common_component
secondary_tags:
  - security-critical
  - privacy-sensitive
confidence: 0.91
evidence:
  - specs/auth.md#overview
  - specs/security.md#session-management
needs_human_review: true

8. End-to-End Workflow

Phase 0 — Project Constitution

Before planning, SIPA should establish or ingest project principles.

Inputs may include:

- architecture principles
- coding standards
- testing standards
- security rules
- stack preferences
- UX rules
- naming conventions
- human review policy

Output:

'''text
constitution.md
'''

This aligns with current Spec Kit practice, where a constitution can govern subsequent specification, planning, and implementation artifacts. ([github.com]([historical-url]

---

Phase 1 — Ingestion and Indexing

Steps:

1. Scan source directories.
2. Respect include/exclude rules.
3. Parse Markdown heading hierarchy.
4. Extract requirement IDs.
5. Detect components, entities, APIs, screens, and decisions.
6. Chunk semantically.
7. Generate embeddings.
8. Build keyword index.
9. Optionally build graph index.
10. Generate corpus summary and glossary.

Outputs:

- `corpus_index.md`
- `glossary.md`
- `chunks.parquet`
- `embeddings.db`
- `knowledge_graph.graphml`
- `ingestion_manifest.json`

---

Phase 2 — Master Plan

The Master Orchestrator:

1. Reads corpus summaries.
2. Retrieves global cross-cutting requirements.
3. Builds initial component inventory.
4. Classifies components.
5. Generates dependency graph.
6. Creates implementation phases.
7. Identifies MVP slice.
8. Flags risks and unknowns.
9. Runs master-plan critic.

Output:

'''text
plans/master_plan.md
'''

noted sections:

- project summary
- scope
- non-goals
- component inventory
- phases
- dependency graph
- risk register
- traceability skeleton
- open questions
- human approval checklist

---

Phase 3 — Type-Aware Sub-Planning

For each component:

1. Confirm component type.
2. Assemble context package.
3. Run relevant sub-planner.
4. Generate draft artifact.
5. Run critic.
6. Patch only failing sections.
7. Re-run critic.
8. Persist approved artifact.

Output examples:

'''text
plans/architecture_core_platform.md
plans/feature_spec_student_dashboard.md
plans/component_spec_auth_service.md
plans/domain_model_user_progress.md
plans/integration_spec_lms_sync.md
plans/security_spec_auth_and_sessions.md
'''

---

Phase 4 — Task Generation

The Task Decomposer creates implementation tasks from approved plans.

Task format:

'''markdown
- [ ] T042 [P] Build StudentDashboardHeader
  - **Component:** Student Dashboard
  - **Source:** feature_spec_student_dashboard.md#ui-header
  - **references:** T011, T018
  - **Acceptance:**
    - Renders avatar, name, role, and notification state.
    - Handles loading and empty-avatar states.
    - Meets responsive behavior defined in section 4.2.
  - **Tests:**
    - Unit render states.
    - E2E dropdown interaction.
  - **Context excerpt:** See linked source section.
'''

---

Phase 5 — Implementation Feedback

After coder agents or humans execute tasks, SIPA ingests:

- diffs
- test results
- review comments
- implementation blockers
- changed assumptions
- failed tasks
- new requirements

SIPA then:

1. Updates episodic memory.
2. Performs impact analysis.
3. Updates affected plans.
4. Re-runs critic gates.
5. Regenerates affected tasks.

---

9. Context Engineering, RAG, and Memory

9.1 Context Package Structure

Every sub-planner receives a context package:

'''yaml
context_package_id: CTX-feature-student-dashboard-v1
component_id: CMP-student-dashboard
planner_type: feature_ui
token_budget:
  max_total: 45000
  source_evidence: 25000
  memory: 5000
  master_context: 5000
  template_and_instructions: 5000
retrievals:
  - chunk_id: CHK-00123
    source: specs/student.md#dashboard
    relevance: 0.94
    trust_level: canonical
  - chunk_id: CHK-00418
    source: specs/ui.md#notifications
    relevance: 0.87
    trust_level: canonical
compression:
  method: extractive_then_abstractive
  preserve_quotes: true
  preserve_requirement_ids: true
'''

9.2 Retrieval Modes

| Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Exact ID lookup | Requirement IDs, ADR IDs, API names |
| BM25 keyword | Exact technical terms |
| Vector search | Semantic similarity |
| Graph traversal | Dependencies and trace links |
| Global summarization | Corpus-wide themes |
| Local neighborhood | Closely related chunks |
| Reranked hybrid | Default production mode |

9.3 Memory Types

| Memory | Scope | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Working | Current run | draft, active critic notes |
| Episodic | Past runs | refinements, implementation feedback |
| Semantic | Generalized knowledge | patterns, glossary, conventions |
| Procedural | Agent behavior | prompts, rubrics, templates |
| Evidence | Source-grounding | chunk IDs, citations, excerpts |
| Security | Trust and permissions | approved tools, blocked actions |

9.4 Evidence Ledger

Every major output claim should map to evidence:

'''yaml
claim_id: CLM-architecture-012
claim: "Auth Service owns session creation and refresh-token rotation."
artifact: component_spec_auth_service.md
evidence:
  - source: specs/auth.md#session-lifecycle
    quote: "..."
  - source: specs/security.md#refresh-token-policy
    quote: "..."
confidence: 0.93
status: supported
'''

10. Critic/Evaluator Subsystem

10.1 Quality Gates

| Gate | noted For | Pass Threshold |
|---|---|---:|
| Traceability | all artifacts | ≥ 0.90 |
| Source fidelity | all artifacts | ≥ 0.92 |
| Internal consistency | all artifacts | ≥ 0.90 |
| Cross-artifact consistency | multi-component plans | ≥ 0.88 |
| Implementability | task lists | ≥ 0.90 |
| Testability | features/components | ≥ 0.90 |
| Security review | tagged artifacts | no high findings |
| Human approval | strategic/high-risk | explicit approval |

      "suggested_patch": "Either link to source requirement or mark as assumption requiring human approval."
    }
  ],
  "recommended_next_action": "targeted_refinement"
}
'''

10.3 Optional SIPA Arena Evaluator

SIPA can run multiple competing planner outputs and evaluate them using the same rubric.

Arena mode should compare:

- traceability
- clarity
- completeness
- risk handling
- taskability
- security posture
- source fidelity

This is independent of any external vendor feature. Official xAI documentation verifies Grok Build plan mode and parallel subagents, but SIPA’s evaluator must remain vendor-neutral. ([x.ai]([historical-url]

---

11. Security and Trust Model

11.1 Core Security Assumptions

1. Retrieved documents may contain malicious instructions.
2. Tool descriptions may be untrusted.
3. Memory can be poisoned.
4. Agent outputs can be wrong even when confident.
5. Human approval is only useful if the UI shows the actual action, not merely the agent’s summary.
6. High-impact operations require deterministic controls outside the LLM.

11.2 Trust Levels

| Trust Level | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| canonical | approved source of truth | reviewed spec |
| trusted-derived | generated from canonical and approved | approved plan |
| unreviewed-derived | generated but not approved | draft plan |
| external | outside corpus | web docs |
| untrusted | user/tool/retrieved content with possible injection | arbitrary webpage |
| hostile-test | adversarial fixture | red-team prompt |

11.3 Tool Permission Policy

| Action | Default |
|---|---|
| Read project specs | allowed |
| Write generated plans | allowed in output directory |
| Modify source code | blocked by SIPA planner |
| Run shell commands | blocked unless explicit tool mode |
| Delete files | human approval noted |
| Access secrets | prohibited |
| Call external APIs | human approval noted |
| Install packages | human approval noted |
| Update memory | allowed only through memory sanitizer |

11.4 Prompt-Injection Controls

SIPA must:

- Wrap retrieved content as untrusted evidence.
- Never let retrieved content override system/developer instructions.
- Strip or flag suspicious instructions in source chunks.
- Separate source evidence from planner instructions.
- Use deterministic policy checks for tool calls.
- Log source-to-claim mappings.
- Require human approval for high-impact actions.

11.5 MCP Controls

If SIPA exposes MCP tools:

- Every tool must have a narrow schema.
- Destructive tools must require explicit approval.
- Tool descriptions must be treated as untrusted unless from trusted servers.
- MCP resources must not be forwarded without consent.
- Tool calls must be logged with inputs, outputs, requester, and artifact ID.

These requirements follow MCP’s own security posture around user consent, tool safety, data privacy, and arbitrary code execution risks. ([modelcontextprotocol.io]([historical-url]

15. Tool and Harness Integration

15.1 Cursor / Claude Code / Kiro / Similar Tools

SIPA should write:

'''text
plans/
tasks/
AGENTS.md
.cursor/rules/
.claude/commands/
'''

Generated `AGENTS.md` should include:

- module conventions
- relevant plan links
- forbidden actions

SIPA integration pattern:

1. SIPA generates approved plan and task pack.
2. Grok Build runs in plan mode.
3. Human compares Grok’s execution plan to SIPA task criteria.
4. Implementation proceeds only after approval.
5. SIPA ingests diffs and test results.

15.3 MCP/API Mode

SIPA can expose:

- `sipa.index_corpus`
- `sipa.get_master_plan`
- `sipa.plan_component`
- `sipa.critique_artifact`
- `sipa.generate_tasks`

Refined Agent Loop: Hierarchical, ReAct-Inspired, Production-Grade Design

**Version:** 2026-06-10 (v3 — Cognitive-Enhanced: Integrated high-priority traditional human thinking models from ranked analysis in thinking_model.md (Cynefin, Premortem, AAR, Double-Loop Learning, RPD, Dual Process, Metacognition, 5 Whys/Fishbone, Red Team, Paul-Elder, etc.) for adaptive context routing, proactive risk mitigation, fast/slow deliberation paths, structured reflection, and deeper self-evolution. All v2 details preserved; new mechanisms are additive, configurable, and mapped to existing phases.)  
**Research Sources**: "Why Do Multi-Agent LLM Systems Fail?" (MASFT taxonomy, 14-18 failure modes), Reflexion, Prospector, CGI, memory papers, xAI docs, developer reports on infinite loops/context issues, plus systematic review of 40+ human cognitive frameworks (ranked by adoption priority for agent loops).
**Purpose:** Actionable reference for building reliable, scalable LLM-based agent systems. Combines academic foundations (ReAct synergy of reasoning + acting), xAI's server-side agentic implementation (multi-agent orchestration for deep research), and advanced hierarchical patterns (planner + specialists + self-evolution).  
**Target Audience:** Builders of harnesses, multi-agent systems, coding agents, research agents (e.g., N1ch01as-style Architect with critic/self-refinement loops).  
**Key Principle:** Controlled loops with explicit state, structured outputs, quality gates, and hierarchical delegation. Not uncontrolled chain reactions — managed orchestration with bubbling-up consolidation and deliberate synthesis.

1. Core Principles (Refined from Research)

1.1 Foundational: ReAct Paradigm (Yao et al., ICLR 2023)
- **Definition**: Interleave **verbal reasoning traces (Thoughts)** with **actions** (tool calls, environment interactions, or delegation). Observations from actions ground and update reasoning.
- **Why it works**:
  - Pure Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Static, prone to hallucinations and error propagation (no external grounding).
  - Pure Acting: No high-level planning, poor exception handling, inefficient trajectories.
  - **ReAct synergy**: Thoughts decompose goals, track progress, handle exceptions, and replan. Actions provide real observations that correct reasoning and enable adaptation. Results in 10-34% gains on interactive tasks and reduced hallucinations on knowledge tasks.
- **Basic Cycle** (one iteration):
  1. **Thought**: LLM reasons about current state, goal, progress, next step, or exception. (Internal, updates context.)
  2. **Action**: Decide and output executable step (tool call with args, sub-agent delegation, or `Finish`/`Done`).
  3. **Observation**: Environment / tool / sub-agent returns structured result (data + metadata: status, confidence, summary, issues).
  4. Append to history/state → repeat.
- **Prompt Structure** (few-shot examples essential): Dense thoughts for reasoning-heavy tasks (QA/research); sparser for embodied/decision tasks. Use explicit tags or JSON schema for parseability.
- **Exception Handling**: Thought step detects failure ("Nothing useful returned") → replans or adjusts action in next iteration.

**xAI Alignment**: Grok's server-side agentic tool calling implements a production ReAct-style loop internally. The model decides tools, executes server-side (web_search, x_search, code_execution, collections_search), iterates until it can produce the final answer. Client sees only final (or streamed) output + optional reasoning tokens.

1.2 Production xAI Multi-Agent Orchestration (2026)
- **grok-4.20-multi-agent** (or equivalent): Launches configurable teams (4 agents for quick/focused; 16 for deep/comprehensive).
- **How the loop works**:
  - Server-side **realtime collaboration**: Multiple specialized agents run in parallel.
  - Each contributes reasoning, tool calls, findings.
  - **Leader agent** synthesizes discussion, cross-references, and delivers final structured answer.
  - Parallel tool invocation and iteration based on intermediate findings.
  - Sub-agent internal states encrypted/hidden by default (control + security); only leader outputs + (optionally) encrypted content exposed.
- **Strengths**: Deep multi-step research, structured outputs (tables, comparisons), realtime refinement, automatic tool use without client intervention in the loop.
- **Plan-first elements**: Complementary patterns in xAI tools like Grok Build CLI use explicit plan generation first, then parallel sub-agent execution (e.g., up to 8 sub-agents in isolated Git worktrees).

1.3 Hierarchical + Self-Evolving (AgentOrchestra / Surveys 2025-2026)
- **Central Planner / Orchestrator / Supervisor** at top level.
- Decomposes into sub-tasks → delegates to **specialized sub-agents** (Deep Researcher, Analyzer, Browser/Tool agents, Reporter, etc.).
- Each sub-agent runs its **own loop** (ReAct-style or domain-optimized).
- **Tree-structured routing** + results bubble up.
- **TEA Protocol inspiration** (Tool-Environment-Agent): Treat tools, environments, and agents as first-class, versioned, lifecycle-managed entities with standardized protocols for context, invocation, and evolution.
- **Closed feedback / Self-evolution**:
  - Reflection (verbal self-critique on traces).
  - Trace-based optimization (e.g., TextGrad-style: attribute errors → propose edits → validate on held-out → version/register).
  - Version manager: Register improved prompts/tools/agents; support rollback/select best.
  - Tracer for full execution trajectories (auditability + optimization signal).
- **Consolidation**: Planner aggregates sub-results, harmonizes evidence, resolves conflicts, updates global plan/state, or triggers refinement. Dedicated Reporter agent often handles final synthesis with citations/deduplication.
- **Performance evidence**: AgentOrchestra-style systems reach 89%+ on GAIA benchmark; sub-agents + self-evolution add double-digit gains; hierarchical routing improves scalability vs flat multi-agent.

**Overall Refined Model**: Start with ReAct core loop. Layer hierarchical delegation for complexity. Add explicit planning phase + reflection/critique gates + structured state/versioning for production reliability. xAI shows this can run server-side with strong orchestration primitives.

1.4 Cognitive Architecture Enhancements from Ranked Human Thinking Models (v3 Addition)

To further strengthen the loop against the failure modes detailed in Section 1.5, v3 explicitly incorporates high-adoption-priority traditional human thinking models (ranked by adoption priority for agent loops in the companion `thinking_model.md` — full table of 40 models with phases, similarities, strengths, and scores). These are mapped as first-class mechanisms rather than afterthoughts, delivering **adaptive intelligence** (context-aware routing), **proactive robustness** (pre-action risk), **efficient cognition** (fast/slow paths), and **deeper organizational learning** (double-loop + structured reflection). Prioritized models (scores 9–10) receive the deepest integration; others enhance specific sub-components (verifier, ideation, harmonization).

**Key Mappings & Operationalization in the v3 Loop**:

| Thinking Model (Rank / Score) | Primary Integration Point | How Operationalized (v3 Enhancement) | Key Benefit vs v2 Baseline |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Cynefin Framework** (1 / 10) | Phase 0 (post-spec) + Phase 1 entry/replan decision | Classify task context: Simple (clear cause-effect) / Complicated (expert analysis) / Complex (emergent) / Chaotic (crisis). Dynamically configure loop params: Fast Recognition Path enabled + lighter gates for Simple/Complicated; Full deliberative + heavy reflection/critics + deeper diagnostics for Complex/Chaotic. | Enables adaptive loop intensity (Fast vs Full) — highest-leverage addition for efficiency + reliability. |
| **Premortem Analysis** (2 / 10) | Phase 0 (after plan gen, before state commit) | Mandatory "assume spectacular failure in 6-12 months → work backward to identify top causes/risks → explicitly mitigate in living spec, success criteria, todo items, or agent roles." Can be run by orchestrator LLM or dedicated Red Team critic. | Directly strengthens Phase 0 planning with proactive risk simulation & critic; near-zero cost. |
| **After-Action Review (AAR)** (3 / 10) | Phase 4 (every milestone reflection or termination) | Structured 4-question template: (1) What was supposed to happen? (vs original spec/plan) (2) What actually happened? (from tracer/obs) (3) Why? (diagnosis) (4) What next? (lessons → concrete evolution actions). Feeds self-evolution. | Perfect upgrade for Phase 4 reflection + self-evolution; highly practical structured learning. |
| **Double-Loop Learning** (4 / 9.5) | Phase 4 (after AAR single-loop fixes) | After tactical fixes, explicitly ask: "What governing variables/assumptions (prompt templates, success criteria definitions, agent role boundaries, memory schemas, verification thresholds, or even the task decomposition strategy) led us here? Should they change at the meta level?" Only then commit versioned updates. | Core to making self-evolution truly powerful (double-loop) rather than symptom patching. |
| **Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD)** (5 / 9.5) + **Dual Process Theory (System 1 & 2)** (8 / 9) | Phase 1 (Thought/Decide step) + Memory layer | **Fast Recognition Path** (new): Before verbose ReAct, query Pattern Store (long-term memory of successful high-quality traces + outcome metadata + embeddings). If strong similarity match (and Cynefin context permits), perform lightweight mental simulation ("Similar to trace #47, expected good result with action Z") then act with minimal tokens. System 1 = fast/intuitive/RPD for routine/expert; System 2 = slow/deliberate full ReAct for novel/risky/uncertain. Metacognition (below) decides switch. Fallback to full loop on low confidence. | Enables high-value "Fast Recognition Path" in v3 for expert domains/repeated tasks; foundation for adaptive fast/slow thinking. |
| **Metacognition Cycle** (7 / 9) | Parallel lightweight process alongside all Phase 1 iterations | Ongoing: Planning (align intent to spec) → Monitoring (bias detection, context fit via Cynefin, progress vs todo/success criteria, confidence drift) → Evaluating (quick rigor pulse) → Adjust (trigger mode switch, early replan, or gate escalation in real time or at next decision). | Direct parallel to state management; easy to implement as lightweight meta-prompt or separate small LLM call. |
| **5 Whys + Ishikawa Fishbone + Fault Tree** (6 / 9) | Phase 4 (AAR "Why?" diagnosis) + Verifier/Critic issue analysis | On persistent failures or low-confidence observations: Drill with iterative 5 Whys; categorize root causes via Fishbone (People/Prompts, Process/Methods, Models/Tools, Data/Material, Environment/Context, Metrics) or simple fault tree. Results drive Double-Loop changes and spec hardening. | Greatly strengthens Thought + Reflection for complex problems; systematic visual + deep cause analysis. |
| **Red Team Thinking** (12 / 8) | Verifier / Phase 3 quality gates + Premortem | Dedicated critic mode or separate lightweight agent: "Adversarially attack this plan/draft/output to surface hidden weaknesses, edge cases, or single points of failure." Complements standard verifier schema. | Strong built-in devil’s advocate; easy to implement as dedicated critic agent role. |
| **Paul-Elder Critical Thinking Framework** (9 / 8.5) | Verifier prompt + Thought step augmentation | Enhance `verify_output` and decision prompts with Elements of Thought (purpose, question at issue, information, concepts, assumptions, inferences, implications, point of view) + Intellectual Standards checklist (clarity, accuracy, precision, relevance, depth, breadth, logic, significance, fairness, sufficiency). | Excellent for enhancing Thought and Verifier quality; strong bias and rigor detection. |
| **Theory of Constraints (TOC)** (10 / 8.5) + **TRIZ** (14 / 8) | Phase 3 (Harmonize/Consolidation) + conflict resolution in self-evolution | When sub-results conflict or goals contradict: Use TOC Evaporating Cloud to surface and resolve core conflicts; apply TRIZ contradiction principles for inventive solutions. Feeds versioned prompt/agent edits. | Powerful for resolving conflicting goals; synergizes extremely well with TRIZ and self-evolution. |
| **Six Thinking Hats** (13 / 8) + **SCAMPER / Osborn-Parnes CPS** (15/11) | Phase 3 consolidation or creative sub-agent ideation | Optional multi-perspective pass (White=facts/data, Red=intuition/feelings, Black=risks/critic, Yellow=benefits/opportunities, Green=creativity/alternatives, Blue=process/meta) or SCAMPER checklist (Substitute/Combine/Adapt/Modify/Put to other uses/Eliminate/Reverse) during synthesis or when sub-agent is creative-writing/design-oriented. | Reduces blind spots effectively; directly upgrades ideation and creative sub-agents. |

**Additional Implementation Details (v3)**:
- **Memory Architecture Upgrade**: Add "Pattern Store" (vector + metadata of successful/failed traces with outcome scores) to support RPD fast matching. Hierarchical memory now explicitly tags traces with Cynefin context type for better retrieval.
- **Verifier / Critic Enhancements**: `verify_output` function now accepts `critic_mode` (or runs ensemble): "standard" | "red_team" | "paul_elder" | "six_hats". Returns aggregated issues + suggestions. Can be parallelized for depth.
- **Configurability in Task Spec**: New fields e.g. `"cognitive_profile": {"enable_fast_path": true, "reflection_style": "aar_double_loop_5whys", "critic_modes": ["red_team", "paul_elder"], "cynefin_classification": "complex"}` or auto-detected.
- **Metacognition Implementation**: Lightweight parallel prompt or small dedicated LLM call every N steps or on confidence drop / context shift. Updates shared state flags (e.g., `current_mode: "fast" | "full"`, `bias_flags: [...]`).
- **Early Exit / Efficiency**: Cynefin + RPD + Metacognition together allow safe early termination or fast-pathing on well-understood sub-problems without sacrificing the rigorous gates on hard parts — directly mitigating token waste and infinite-loop risks.

These additions are **production-aware**: all new steps are bounded, versioned, logged via tracer, and can be toggled or depth-limited per task. They transform the agent from a capable ReAct/hierarchical engine (v2) into a more cognitively complete system that thinks about its own thinking, anticipates failure, learns at multiple levels, and adapts its deliberation style to context — while fully preserving every v2 mechanism, code example, and mitigation.

1.5 Known Problems, Failure Modes & Targeted Mitigations (Research-Backed)

Recent systematic studies (especially the **MASFT taxonomy** from analysis of 150+ traces across popular multi-agent frameworks) identify that **most failures stem from design/spec issues (~40%+)**, coordination breakdowns, and weak verification/termination — **not raw model intelligence**. Single-agent ReAct loops suffer overlapping issues plus context bloat and repetitive behavior. Below is a synthesized taxonomy of the most common, well-documented problems, with **actionable mitigations** mapped directly to the phases in this document.

Major Problem Categories & Frequency/Significance
1. **Specification & Design Ambiguities (Largest Category)**
   - Disobeying or misinterpreting task spec, vague roles, missing success criteria or output contracts.
   - **Impact**: Agents go off-track early; errors compound downstream.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Phase 0: Mandatory structured Task Specification with explicit success criteria, constraints, output schema, and quality thresholds. Use "living spec" that can be updated.
     - Add automated spec validation (critic or schema check) before loop starts.
     - Clear role definitions and information contracts between orchestrator and sub-agents.

2. **Infinite Loops, Repetitive Actions & Thrashing**
   - Agent repeats the same (or similar) actions without progress; common in ReAct from poor exception handling or missing info; can be induced by prompt injection.
   - **Impact**: Wasted tokens/cost, timeouts, frustration (frequent real-world complaint).
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Phase 1 loop: Add **cycle detection** (state hashing of recent actions + observations; if similarity > threshold, force replan or terminate).
     - Explicit `max_steps`, `max_reflection_rounds`, and progress-based early exit (e.g., todo completion %).
     - Bounded reflection: Limit "improve this" iterations.
     - `Done` / `Finish` tool with mandatory verification before acceptance.
     - In hierarchical: Orchestrator monitors sub-agent progress and can kill/reassign stuck branches.

3. **Context Window Explosion / Context Rot / History Bloat**
   - Long trajectories cause key early info or instructions to be dropped; leads to inconsistency, repetition, goal drift.
   - **Impact**: Degraded performance in long-running or multi-turn tasks.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Aggressive hierarchical memory: Short-term working memory + long-term persistent store (vector search, semantic caching, MemGPT-style).
     - Summarization at milestones or when context > threshold (signal-aware truncation).
     - Structured state (`task.md`, todo list, key facts only) instead of dumping full history every turn.
     - Sub-agents receive only relevant context slices + provenance.

4. **Hallucinations, Error Compounding & Verification Weakness**
   - Fabricated facts, incorrect tool results interpretation, or unverified claims propagating (worse in multi-agent).
   - **Impact**: Unreliable final outputs; cascading failures.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - **Verifier / Critic agents** as mandatory quality gates (Phase 3 consolidation and after sub-results).
     - Structured observation schema (status, confidence, issues list) + cross-validation (compare across agents/sources).
     - Multi-form verification (factual grounding in observations + external checks).
     - Trajectory ranking (e.g., Prospector-style critic selects best among multiple attempts).
     - In self-evolution: Only commit changes validated on held-out traces.

5. **Inter-Agent Misalignment & Coordination Failures (Multi-Agent Specific)**
   - Role overstepping, conflicting goals, stale state sharing, communication gaps, error propagation between agents.
   - **Impact**: Poor collaboration; sometimes single strong agent outperforms complex MAS.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Strong central **Orchestrator/Planner** with explicit decomposition and routing (hierarchical control beats flat).
     - Information contracts + structured handoff formats.
     - Versioned shared state + durable coordination primitives (e.g., streams, pub/sub).
     - Circuit breakers: Detect inconsistency → pause, reconcile, or escalate.
     - Clear "Extreme hierarchical differentiation" (well-defined specialist roles).

6. **Termination & Goal Drift Problems**
   - Premature stopping (incomplete work) or failure to recognize completion; agents continue or give up wrongly.
   - **Impact**: Wrong or partial results.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Explicit success criteria in spec + progress tracking against them.
     - Dedicated termination action (`Done` tool) that must pass verifier.
     - Periodic alignment checks in Thought step vs original objective.
     - Early termination signals when intermediate results satisfy criteria.

7. **Other Notable Issues**
   - **State staleness & memory failures**: Use hybrid memory (fast short-term + persistent long-term with retrieval).
   - **Security (prompt injection → loops or misuse)**: Sandbox tools, input sanitization, least-privilege tool access, monitoring for anomalous loops.
   - **Cost & scalability overhead**: Multi-agent only when benefit > coordination cost; monitor token usage per phase; parallel where safe.
   - **Debuggability**: Full tracer + structured logs are non-negotiable.

How Mitigations Integrate into the Loop Phases
- **Phase 0 (Init)**: Spec engineering + validation is the single highest-ROI fix.
- **Phase 1 (Core Loop)**: Cycle detection, bounded steps/reflection, structured observations, progress tracking.
- **Phase 2 (Delegation)**: Narrow sub-specs + contracts; orchestrator monitoring.
- **Phase 3 (Consolidation)**: Verifier/critic gates, cross-validation, harmonization.
- **Phase 4 (Reflection/Self-evolution)**: Validation before applying changes; bounded loops.
- **Phase 5 (Termination)**: Verifier + explicit Done with evidence.

**Key Insight from Research**: Fixing **specification quality + verification layers + explicit termination controls** delivers the largest reliability gains. Adding more agents or raw model power without these often yields diminishing or negative returns.

2. The Complete Agent Loop Process (Actionable)

Phase 0: Initialization (Spec-Driven Setup)
**Goal**: Establish clear contract before any loop iterations.
1. Parse human instruction → generate/validate **Task Specification** (structured: objective, success criteria, constraints, output format, max budget/steps/tokens, quality thresholds).
2. Create **initial state**:
   - `task.md` or structured scratchpad (current plan, todo list, progress, open questions).
   - Memory: Short-term (recent observations), long-term (retrieved knowledge, past versions).
   - Tracer / execution log (for later reflection).
   - Version registry (for prompts/tools/agents if evolving).
3. **Optional Plan Generation** (Plan-and-Execute flavor, recommended for complex tasks):
   - Orchestrator LLM generates high-level plan (numbered steps or dependency graph).
   - Validate plan against spec (self-critique or dedicated critic).
   - Store in state.
4. **v3 Cognitive Enhancements (Cynefin + Premortem)**:
   - **Cynefin Classification** (context-aware routing): LLM or lightweight classifier tags the task (Simple / Complicated / Complex / Chaotic) based on clarity of cause-effect, expert knowledge needed, emergence, or crisis nature. Store in task_spec and use to auto-configure loop behavior (see 1.4 table): e.g., Simple/Complicated → prefer Fast Recognition Path + reduced reflection depth; Complex/Chaotic → enforce Full mode + AAR/Double-Loop + multi-critic ensemble.
   - **Premortem Analysis** (proactive risk critic): Before finalizing state, run dedicated step (orchestrator or Red Team critic): "Imagine this plan and spec have failed spectacularly after deployment. List the top 5-7 plausible causes. For each, propose concrete mitigations (update success_criteria, add todo risk items, tighten constraints, adjust agent roles, or add verification gates)." Merge mitigations into living spec and initial todo. This is now a recommended mandatory gate for all but the simplest tasks.
5. Decide architecture: Flat ReAct (simple) vs Hierarchical (complex research/coding) vs Hybrid. Also set initial `cognitive_profile` flags from Cynefin + task type (enable_fast_path, reflection_style, etc.).

**Actionable Output Format** (example JSON or Markdown section):
'''json
{
  "task_id": "...",
  "objective": "...",
  "success_criteria": ["...", "..."],
  "constraints": ["max_steps: 50", "budget_tokens: 200k"],
  "output_format": "structured report with citations",
  "initial_plan": ["Step 1: ...", "Step 2: ..."],
  "quality_gates": ["completeness > 90%", "no hallucinations", "structured output"]
}
'''

Phase 1: Core Iteration Loop (ReAct-Inspired, Controlled)
While not terminated:
**v3 Mode Selection (Cynefin + RPD + Dual Process + Metacognition)**: At loop start or after major observation, determine operating mode:
- If Cynefin context is Simple/Complicated **and** high-similarity match found in Pattern Store (RPD) **and** metacognition confidence high → enter **Fast Recognition Path**: lightweight Thought (mental simulation only), skip verbose reasoning, proceed to action with minimal tokens. Log as "fast_path" for later AAR review.
- Otherwise (Complex/Chaotic, low pattern match, or explicit config) → **Full Deliberative Mode** (standard detailed ReAct Thought + full gates). Metacognition runs lightweight parallel monitor (bias scan, progress pulse, context drift check) and can force mode switch mid-iteration if uncertainty spikes.

1. **Observe Current State**: Load full/relevant history + task spec + current plan/todo + latest observations. (Summarize aggressively if context long — use memory manager. Also retrieve relevant Pattern Store entries for RPD matching.)
2. **Reason (Thought)**:
   - **Metacognitive overlay** (parallel): "Am I in the right mode? Any detected biases (per Paul-Elder)? Progress vs success criteria and todo? Context still matches Cynefin tag? Any governing assumptions to flag for Double-Loop later?"
   - Analyze progress vs success criteria.
   - Identify gaps, risks, exceptions.
   - Decide strategy: direct tool, delegate sub-task, synthesize so far, reflect/critique, or finish. (In Fast mode: keep this extremely concise.)
   - Update internal plan or todo if needed.
3. **Act / Decide Next** (strict structured output — parseable):
   - **Option A (Tool)**: Call built-in or custom tool (with args). xAI-style: server handles execution in loop.
   - **Option B (Delegate)**: Invoke sub-agent with narrow sub-instruction + context slice + success criteria for that sub-task. (Hierarchical)
   - **Option C (Internal)**: Update state/plan only, or run critic on draft.
   - **Option D (Finish)**: Output final answer if quality gates passed.
4. **Execute & Observe**:
   - Run action (tool or sub-agent loop).
   - Collect **structured observation**:
     '''json
     {
       "status": "success | partial | failed",
       "data": {...},
       "summary": "concise natural language",
       "confidence": 0.85,

   - Append to history + update todo/state.
5. **Light Reflection** (every N steps or on failure): Quick self-critique — "Is this trajectory still aligned? Any obvious fix?"

**Circuit Breaker Pattern (Recommended for Production)**

Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures when a tool, LLM call, or sub-agent is repeatedly failing. They have three states:
- **CLOSED**: Normal operation, requests go through.
- **OPEN**: Too many failures → fast-fail immediately (protects the system).
- **HALF_OPEN**: After timeout, allow limited test requests to check recovery.

Use one circuit breaker per tool type or per sub-agent role. Integrate with the retry wrappers below.

'''

**Termination Conditions** (checked every iteration or at gates):
- Success criteria met + quality gate passed.
- Max steps / token budget / time reached.
- Explicit `Done` / `Finish` action with validated output.
- Irrecoverable failure (escalate to human or higher orchestrator).
- Early exit if intermediate result satisfies objective.

Phase 2: Hierarchical Delegation & Sub-Loops
When orchestrator decides to delegate:
1. **Decompose & Route**:
   - Planner selects or instantiates appropriate sub-agent type (specialist role, toolset, prompt template).
   - Creates narrow sub-task spec (subset of parent objective + relevant context slice).
   - Invokes sub-agent (can be same LLM with different system prompt/role, or different model).
2. **Sub-Agent Runs Independent Loop**:
   - Sub-agent executes its own ReAct-style iterations (or optimized variant) against its sub-spec.
   - Maintains local state/memory.
   - Can further delegate (tree) or call tools.
3. **Return Structured Result** to parent (bubbles up):
   - Same structured observation format above.
   - Includes provenance (which sub-agent, trace summary).
4. **Parent Handles**:
   - Records in global state/tracer.
   - Validates/integrates (merge with other branches, resolve conflicts via harmonization step).
   - Updates global plan/todo.
   - Decides next: more delegation, direct action, consolidate, or critique.

**Parallelism**: Where dependencies allow (e.g., independent research branches), run multiple sub-agents/tools concurrently (xAI multi-agent style or worktree isolation like Grok Build).

Phase 3: Consolidation, Synthesis & Restructuring
After sub-results or major milestones:
1. **Aggregate**: Collect all relevant observations + plan progress.
2. **Harmonize**: LLM (or dedicated Reporter agent) merges, deduplicates, cross-references, resolves contradictions. Produces unified view.
3. **Restructure**: Transform into target output shape (report, code, answer, updated plan). Enforce format from initial spec.
4. **Quality Gate**:
   - Run critic/refiner: Score against success criteria, check for hallucinations/gaps, suggest fixes.
   - If fails: Trigger refinement loop (re-plan, re-delegate specific parts, or self-edit).
   - If passes: Proceed (or do final polish).
5. **Update State**: Persist consolidated knowledge to long-term memory / versioned artifacts.

**Example Consolidator Prompt Snippet**:
"You are a synthesis expert. Given the original task spec, current plan, and these sub-results [structured list], produce: 1) Updated progress summary. 2) Any conflicts resolved. 3) Draft final output section. 4) Remaining gaps and recommended next actions."

Phase 4: Reflection, Critique & Self-Evolution (Advanced)
**v3 Structured Reflection (AAR + Double-Loop + 5 Whys / Ishikawa + Paul-Elder / Red Team)**: All reflections now follow an explicit, multi-layered protocol (configurable via task_spec.reflection_style). This upgrades the original verbal self-critique into a rigorous, multi-model cognitive process.

- **Mandatory AAR Template** (applied at every milestone, failure, or termination; directly from After-Action Review best practice):
  1. **What was supposed to happen?** — Re-state relevant parts of original task_spec, success criteria, plan, and expected observations.
  2. **What actually happened?** — Summarize from tracer + structured observations (successes, partials, errors, key metrics). Include Fast vs Full mode usage stats if applicable.
  3. **Why? (Diagnosis)** — 
     - First pass: Standard attribution (TextGrad-style or LLM).
     - Deep pass (if issues or Cynefin=Complex): Apply **5 Whys** iteratively on top 2-3 problems. Then categorize using **Ishikawa Fishbone** (or lightweight fault tree): e.g., Prompts/Methods, Models/Tools/Agents, Data/Observations, Context/Environment, State/Memory, Verification Gates, Human Spec.
     - Cross-check with **Paul-Elder** lens: Which elements of thought were weak? Which intellectual standards violated (accuracy? depth? fairness?)?
  4. **What next? (Actionable Lessons)** — Concrete, versionable changes. Prioritize by impact/effort.

- **Double-Loop Learning Layer** (always after AAR single-loop diagnosis, before committing changes):
  - "Beyond fixing the immediate symptoms: What *governing variables* or foundational assumptions created the conditions for this outcome? Examples: Was our definition of 'quality output' too loose? Did agent role boundaries allow drift? Is the memory retrieval strategy misaligned with task type? Should success criteria themselves evolve? Should we add new critic roles or change loop routing logic?"
  - Only changes that survive this meta-question are proposed for validation + registration. This prevents superficial patching and enables genuine architectural self-improvement.

- **Per-trajectory or milestone reflection** (original): LLM summarizes trace, diagnoses failures/successes, proposes improvements (prompt edits, tool patches, new sub-agent types). Now wrapped inside the AAR + Double-Loop structure above.

- **Self-evolution loop** (inspired by AgentOrchestra, enhanced):
  1. Collect trace via tracer + AAR output.
  2. Attribute errors / opportunities (LLM or TextGrad-style) **within AAR/Double-Loop frame**.
  3. Propose targeted changes (to prompts, tools, agent configs, success criteria, or even generated code / memory schemas).
  4. Validate changes (re-execute on held-out or similar task; check metrics; optionally re-run Premortem on proposed new version).
  5. If improved (and Double-Loop approved): Register new version (with lineage + AAR justification). Support rollback. Update Pattern Store with outcome metadata for future RPD use.
  6. Optional: If change is meta (e.g., new critic mode or routing rule), propagate to cognitive_profile defaults.

- **Critic Agent Role** (enhanced): Separate lightweight agent that reviews drafts/plans without full execution. Can be invoked at gates. Now supports multiple modes (standard | red_team | paul_elder | six_hats | ensemble) as defined in Section 1.4. Red Team mode is especially recommended during Premortem and high-stakes consolidation.

- **Benefits**: Continuous improvement during runtime; production systems become more robust over repeated use on similar task distributions. The combination of AAR structure, Double-Loop depth, systematic root-cause (5 Whys/Fishbone), and multi-perspective critics (Paul-Elder/Red Team) makes Phase 4 a true engine for compounding intelligence rather than just incremental fixes. Fast-path traces are still reviewed (lighter AAR) so the system can learn when to trust RPD matches.

**Implementation Tip**: Store AAR outputs as structured artifacts linked to versions in the registry. This creates an auditable "learning history" that future agents (or the same system on similar tasks) can retrieve for RPD-style pattern matching.

Phase 5: Termination & Output
- When gates passed or termination condition met:
  1. Final synthesis pass.
  2. Structured final output (match spec).
  3. Optional: Post-hoc reflection summary for user or logging.
  4. Persist full trace + versions for audit/replay/debug.
- **Human-in-loop hooks**: At quality gate failures, high-stakes actions, or budget exhaustion.

3. State, Memory & Infrastructure Recommendations

- **State Schema**: task_spec + current_plan/todo + history (thought/action/observation tuples) + memory (key-value or vector) + versions + tracer.
- **Memory Management**: Hierarchical (local per sub-agent + global). Summarization on context pressure. Session-isolated for concurrency.
- **Tracing**: Full execution graph (who called what, results, timings, versions). Enables debugging, reflection, and optimization.
- **Versioning** (TEA-inspired): Prompts, tools, agent roles, generated artifacts — all versioned with semantic lineage and rollback.
- **xAI Integration Tips**:
  - Use Grok multi-agent mode for research-heavy top-level tasks.
  - Mix server-side agentic tools with client-side custom tools (hybrid).
  - For coding agents: Adopt plan-first + parallel sub-agents in isolated environments (worktrees).
  - Stream reasoning tokens when possible for transparency.
- **Production Hardening**:
  - Strict output schemas (JSON mode or constrained decoding).
  - Timeouts, retry with backoff, circuit breakers on failing tools/sub-agents.
  - Cost/token budgets + monitoring.
  - Logging + observability (every thought/action/observation).
  - Sandboxed execution for tools/code.

4. Decision Framework (When to Use What)

| Task Complexity       | Recommended Pattern                  | Key Features to Enable          | Example Use Case |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|
| Simple fact lookup    | Flat ReAct (single loop)            | Tool calling, basic thought    | Quick search + answer |
| Multi-step research   | xAI Multi-Agent or Hierarchical     | Parallel agents, leader synth  | Deep analysis with sources |
| Coding / long project | Plan-first + Hierarchical + Worktrees | Sub-agents in isolation, todo.md | Full app generation + debug |
| Open-ended / creative | ReAct + Reflection + Self-evolution | Critic gates, versioned prompts| Iterative design refinement |
| High-stakes / reliable| All above + strong Quality Gates    | Structured results, validation | Enterprise automation |

5. Common Pitfalls & Mitigations (from Research)

**Primary reference: See the full MASFT-style taxonomy, failure modes, and phase-specific mitigations in Section 1.5 above.** The points below are retained for quick scanning and now include additional patterns from recent studies.

- **Context explosion**: Aggressive summarization + hierarchical state (local sub-memories).
- **Infinite loops / thrashing**: Hard max iterations + progress tracking in todo + critic that can force replan or escalate.
- **Poor consolidation**: Mandate structured sub-results + dedicated harmonization/reporter step.
- **Hallucinations in plans**: Ground every major claim in observations; use critic before committing to plan.
- **Brittle delegation**: Use explicit sub-task specs + success criteria; validate returned results.
- **Lack of visibility**: Full tracing + optional streaming of reasoning.

**Next Steps for Implementation**:
1. Start with a minimal ReAct harness in your preferred framework (LangGraph, custom loop, or xAI SDK).
2. Add structured observation schema and todo/state management.
3. Layer hierarchical delegation + consolidation.
4. Instrument tracing + quality gates.
5. Experiment with reflection/self-evolution on repeated task types.
6. Integrate xAI multi-agent mode for research sub-tasks.

7. Data Flow & Handoff Contracts

Every agent communicates via a **Shared Artifact Handoff Contract** (machine-readable JSON manifest):

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `artifact_id` / `version` | Unique identity for every output and revision |
| `parent_assets` | Provenance links to scripts, prompts, plates, stems |
| `brief_scope` | Subtask, acceptance criteria, target audience |
| `technical_spec` | Codec, aspect ratio, duration, frame rate, color space, loudness |
| `rights_and_consent` | License state, likeness/voice consent, territorial limits |
| `continuity_state` | Character look, props, wardrobe, environment, identity hash |
| `qc_status` | Latest L1/L2/L3 QC result |
| `target_channels` | Theatrical, streaming, broadcast, social, CRM, LMS |
| `provenance_manifest` | C2PA reference, critique log pointer, sign-off chain |

> **Full contract spec:** [ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §1.3

7.1 Critique Bus Protocol

All agents communicate critique via a structured JSON bus:

'''json
{
  "from_agent": "EditorAgent",
  "to_agent": "DirectorAgent",
  "critique_type": "pacing_feedback",
  "severity": "suggestion",
  "artifact_ref": "artifact_id_123_v2",
  "message": "Scene 3 pacing exceeds genre-prior by 15%; suggest trim.",
  "rubric_score": 0.72,
  "timestamp": "2026-05-27T10:30:00Z"
}
'''

**Build:**
- `packages/eventbus`: typed Redis Streams pub/sub; topic contract (§5.7); replayable; at-least-once + idempotency keys.
- `packages/observability`: OTel tracing + structured logs + LangSmith hookup; every node run is a span.
- `services/orchestrator`:
  - **LangGraph graph runtime**: nodes = agent tasks; conditional edges; **HiTL interrupt** points (gates); checkpointer backed by Postgres.
  - **Temporal workflows/activities**: each agent task is a Temporal activity (retry/backoff/timeout); the production is a Temporal workflow (resumable across restarts).
  - **OrchestratorAgent / PlannerAgent / RouterAgent / JudgeAgent / GateKeeperAgent / MemoryAgent** skeletons (agents #53–58) — these are *platform* agents, built here, refined in M8.
  - DAG primitives: fan-out/fan-in, dependency-triggered rerender, deadlock detection, SLA timers.
- `packages/memory`: episodic + long-term project memory (Reflexion/MemGPT pattern) over the vector DB; `MemoryAgent` retrieval API.
- Asset/Data backbone: immutable `artifact_id`, copy-on-write versions, dependency edges, searchable metadata (Postgres + S3/MinIO), C2PA signing via `packages/provenance`.
- State store: production state machine; gate state; durable, auditable, resumable.

**Acceptance Gate G-M2:** A hard-coded 3-node DAG (`Planner → echo-agent → GateKeeper`) runs end-to-end on real Temporal+Redis+Postgres, survives a mid-run worker kill, emits correct typed events, and signs artifacts with C2PA. ✅ This is the *walking skeleton*.

**Build:**
- **Orchestration (53–58):** harden Orchestrator/Planner/Router/Judge/GateKeeper/Memory with full dispute-resolution (multi-agent debate), stage-gate sign-off, and escaped-defect=0 discipline.
- **Creative (59–65):** Ideation, NarrativeArc, StyleTransfer, MoodBoard, Novelty/Anti-Cliché, EmotionalArc, WorldBuilding — many delegate to GCA/Aesthetics (no duplication).
- **Research (66–72):** Web/Archive/Trend/Competitor/Citation/InterviewSynthesis/Benchmark — built on the M4 Research Agent core.
- **Optimization (73–80):** Prompt/Cost/Latency/Retention/ROAS/Accessibility optimizers + EvaluationHarness + SafetyRedTeam.
- **Full QC mesh**: complete L3 (AudienceSim ≥200 personas + HiTL sampling) and Q1–Q6 delivery validators; `GateKeeperAgent` enforces "zero leaked defects."

**Tests:** Judge inter-rater agreement κ≥0.8 vs a fixture human-panel; GateKeeper blocks a seeded defect; SafetyRedTeam attack-success ≤1% on the seeded attack set; EvaluationHarness detects an injected regression <1h; AudienceSim L3 win-rate computed on a golden pair.

10.4 The non-negotiable release predicate
An artifact is releasable **iff**: `L1==pass AND L2>=85 AND L3>=threshold AND all(Q1..Q6) AND compliance==clear AND c2pa_signed AND budget_ok`. Encode this as a single `qc.release_ok(artifact)` function; the GateKeeperAgent calls only this.

Theme 4 — Quality Mesh (31–40)
31. `qc.release_ok()` is the single release predicate; GateKeeper calls only it.
32. L1 deterministic validators cover codec/aspect/duration/frame-rate/LUFS/captions.
33. L2 judges are pinned (model+prompt version); score variance within tolerance across reruns.
34. L3 AudienceSim uses ≥200 personas + ≥20 HiTL; win-rate computed correctly.
35. Q1–Q6 delivery mesh each implemented and gating.
36. Continuity (Q4) detects identity/wardrobe/prop drift via `identity_hash`.
37. Aesthetic scoring returns decomposed vector + `hack_likelihood`; low confidence escalates.
38. Reward-hacking defenses active (ensemble disagreement, variance monitoring).
39. Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA min) gated for any human-facing output.
40. A seeded defect is reliably caught and blocked before release.

| **Live DAG Visibility** | The Composition Diagram runs in real-time; users must see agent state at a glance |
| **Gate-Driven Confidence** | GateKeeperAgent phase transitions surface as explicit approval moments in the UI |
| **Critique Transparency** | Every agent critique message is viewable, searchable, and actionable |
| **Production-Type Aware** | The 10 workflow templates (A–J) shape which agents activate and which panels appear |

Migration capability research (v1 honest · 2026-07-13)

Role-specific capability research for **GateKeeperAgent** (`video.gatekeeper`, va_id=57, category `9-Meta`).

Responsibility focus
Phase transitions; verifies L1/L2/L3 criteria; signs C2PA

Prompt research topics (source of truth for S3)
- arXiv topics: 1. Retrieve and integrate state-of-the-art research findings from arXiv papers relevant to: stage-gate quality systems, C2PA provenance, release criteria automation, policy-as-code gates
- X topics: 2. Analyze and incorporate expert insights from x.ai (Twitter/X) from recognized industry and academic leaders specializing in: AI content gates, provenance signing C2PA, automated release QA
- YouTube topics: 3. Extract detailed, actionable technical guidance from high-quality YouTube content created by domain experts focused on: phase gates in production pipelines, C2PA and content authenticity, automated QC gates

arXiv / academic integration (role-applied)
- Constitutional AI constitutions as phase-gate criteria
- C2PA / provenance signing for artifact handoff integrity

**How this agent uses it:** encode the above as self-quality checks, critique inputs, and design-time tool notes — not as host allow-list expansions.

X / industry practice (role-applied)
- Stage-gate methodology in AI production pipelines

YouTube / practitioner guidance (role-applied)
- QC sign-off flows; never silent phase advance

Implementation notes for v1
1. Emit artifacts matching role responsibility; self-score against Self-quality criteria.
2. Accept critique only from listed critics; escalate disputes to Judge/Gate as DNA dictates.
3. Design-time tools remain documented only; runtime tools stay in `agent_spec.json`.
4. N1: no second control plane; video logic under `business/video/**` only.

Research depth note (honest)
This v1 section maps **role-family** literature and the agent’s migration prompt topics into SPEC.
It is **not** a full unsummarized download of every paper/video transcript.
Live primary-source expansion remains a residual for score 100 on S3 where depth is still thin.

## Prompts

### `prompts/primary.md`

# Prompt — `video.prompt.gatekeeper.v1`

> Materialized by `scripts/business/improve_agents_from_plan_v1.py` for improvement plan Wave A.
> Patterns: Constitutional AI, Agent Skills
> Research: Anthropic Agent Skills; Self-Refine; ReAct; LLM-as-Judge; LangGraph-style handoffs (see IMPROVEMENT_RESEARCH_SOURCES_v1.md).

## System

You are **GateKeeperAgent (VA Domain Pack)** (`video.gatekeeper`), a pack agent in the video domain swarm.

### Responsibility (owns)
Phase transitions; verifies L1/L2/L3 criteria; signs C2PA

### Does not own
- Host credential storage
- Silent production activation without fail-closed gates
- Inventing action references for irreversible mutations
- Owning other agents' exclusive craft outputs without handoff contract

### Operating principles
1. Stay inside responsibility; use typed handoffs for everything else.
2. Prefer evidence and pack sources over invention.
3. Fail closed on missing credentials, missing tools, or irreversible actions without HiTL.
4. Emit structured artifacts that validate against L1 schema before self-scoring.
5. Accept peer critique; refine at most 3 times; escalate blockers.

### Architecture pattern
Constitutional AI (constitution = phase-gate criteria)

### Knowledge grounding
Use only: pack `sources/`, approved memory namespaces, and tool outputs.
Primary distillation sources (design): Stage-gate methodology; PGA Producers Mark; QMS audit

## Developer

### Tools (allowlist intent)
Design tool surface: C2PA signing (c2patool); JSON schema validators; rubric evaluation endpoints
Runtime: only host-registered `allowed_tools` from agent_spec.json. Never invent credentials.

### Collaboration
- Accepts critique from: ComplianceAgent, AIQAConsistencyAgent
- May comment on: OrchestratorAgent (premature advance)
- Critique / instruction messages must include: from_id, to_id, severity (blocker|major|minor|nit), artifact_ref, claim, evidence_refs, correlation_id.

### Self-evaluation loop (before final emit)
1. **L1 Spec** — structural/schema/format validators must pass 100%.
2. **L2 Rubric** — score each dimension; average weighted score must be >= 85/100 or refine.
3. **L3 Preference** — if pairwise/arena data exists, prefer higher win-rate variant; else skip.
Criteria (design): Zero leaked defects; sign-off SLA ≥99%

### Refine policy
- On major/blocker self-fail or inbound critique: revise once and re-score.
- After 3 failed refinements: emit `status=needs_hitl` with unresolved items.
- Never silently drop blockers.

## Task

You will receive a host task envelope:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "video.gatekeeper",
  "correlation_id": "string",
  "goal": "string",
  "inputs": {},
  "constraints": {},
  "prior_critiques": []
}
```

Execute the craft step for **GateKeeperAgent (VA Domain Pack)**. Use the architecture pattern above (reason → optional tool calls → self-review → emit).

## Output schema (required)

```json
{
  "agent_id": "video.gatekeeper",
  "correlation_id": "string",
  "status": "ok | needs_refine | needs_hitl | failed",
  "artifact": {
    "type": "string",
    "payload": {},
    "summary": "string"
  },
  "l1": { "passed": true, "checks": [] },
  "l2": { "score": 0, "dimensions": [], "passed": false },
  "critiques_emitted": [],
  "handoffs": [],
  "evidence_refs": [],
  "refinement_count": 0,
  "notes": "string"
}
```

## Few-shot discipline
- Prefer short, verifiable claims over marketing language.
- Never claim human-surpass without evidence_refs to measured baselines.
- Mark production-only tool use as unavailable when flags/credentials are off.

<!-- RETHINK_100:start -->
## RETHINK_100 operating guidance (design-time)

> Derived from `ui/RETHINK_100_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for `video.gatekeeper`.
> Does **not** enable production models or network. Host `agent_spec.json` remains authoritative.

### Applied item ids
6, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 36, 37, 38, 42, 46, 55, 59, 62, 63, 87, 88, 93, 94

### Design-time model landscape (non-activating)
- Kling 2.6/3.0 variants (design-time only)

### Obligations
- Host control plane owns orchestration; this agent never opens a second control plane.
- Runtime tools remain agent_spec.allowed_tools only; RETHINK model names are design-time.
- Fail closed when tools/providers are unavailable (circuit-breaker posture).
- Prefer iterative verify → refine ≤ max_refinement_count → HiTL over silent pass.
- Emit plain-English reasoning summary in artifacts for operator trust.
- Attach provenance / correlation_id / evidence_refs on every handoff.
- Verify intermediate narrative/script artifacts before advancing downstream handoffs.
- Escalate stereotype/harm/consent risks to ethics/trust-safety/legal gates.

### Collaboration with host architecture
- Commands arrive only via host task envelopes.
- Publish results as structured artifacts; never open browser/UI channels.
- On tool failure: degrade gracefully (circuit-breaker), emit recoverable error, do not invent success.

## Few-shot discipline
- Prefer short, verifiable claims over marketing language.
- Never claim human-surpass without evidence_refs to measured baselines.
- Mark production-only tool use as unavailable when flags/credentials are off.

<!-- RETHINK_100:start -->
## RETHINK_100 operating guidance (design-time)

> Derived from `ui/RETHINK_100_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for `video.gatekeeper`.
> Does **not** enable production models or network. Host `agent_spec.json` remains authoritative.

### Applied item ids
6, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 36, 37, 38, 42, 46, 55, 59, 62, 63, 87, 88, 93, 94

### Design-time model landscape (non-activating)
- Kling 2.6/3.0 variants (design-time only)

### Obligations
- Host control plane owns orchestration; this agent never opens a second control plane.
- Runtime tools remain agent_spec.allowed_tools only; RETHINK model names are design-time.
- Fail closed when tools/providers are unavailable (circuit-breaker posture).
- Prefer iterative verify → refine ≤ max_refinement_count → HiTL over silent pass.
- Emit plain-English reasoning summary in artifacts for operator trust.
- Attach provenance / correlation_id / evidence_refs on every handoff.
- Verify intermediate narrative/script artifacts before advancing downstream handoffs.
- Escalate stereotype/harm/consent risks to ethics/trust-safety/legal gates.

### Collaboration with host architecture
- Commands arrive only via host task envelopes.
- Publish results as structured artifacts; never open browser/UI channels.
- On tool failure: degrade gracefully (circuit-breaker), emit recoverable error, do not invent success.

# AI Agent Video Production Workflow

> Companion to `human_video_production_workflow.md`. For every human crew role in the master roster, this document defines the **AI agent** that replaces (or augments) it, along with: scope of duties, knowledge-distillation pipeline, self-quality criteria, signals that the agent has surpassed a human professional, how the agent accepts critique from other agents, and what the agent is qualified to critique in return.

---

## 1. System Foundations and Reference-Scanning Plan

| Pattern | Purpose | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-Refine** | Agent drafts → self-critiques against rubric → revises | Madaan et al., 2023 |
| **Reflexion** | Agent stores verbal feedback in episodic memory, retries | Shinn et al., 2023 |
| **RLAIF / Constitutional AI** | Reward signal from AI critic governed by a written constitution | Bai et al., 2022 |
| **Multi-agent debate** | Two+ agents argue; judge agent picks the better answer | Du et al., 2023 (LLM debate) |
| **LLM-as-Judge with rubric** | Frozen judge model scores outputs against pre-registered rubric | Zheng et al., 2023 (MT-Bench) |
| **Pairwise preference (Arena)** | Blind A/B vote between agent output and human reference | LMSYS Chatbot Arena methodology |
| **Tool-use / ReAct** | Agent reasons + calls external tools (renderers, validators) | Yao et al., 2022 |
| **Agentic graph (CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph)** | Roles orchestrated as a DAG with handoffs and review gates | CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph |
| **Provenance (C2PA)** | Every artifact signed; downstream agents verify the chain | C2PA spec |

All agents below are assumed to be implemented as orchestrated nodes in a CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph topology, with tool access to generative video models (Sora, Veo, Runway, Kling), TTS/voice-clone APIs (ElevenLabs, Sync.so, Hedra), DCC tooling (Resolve, Nuke, AE via MCP bridges), and a shared critique bus.

### 1.1 Reference Scanning and Knowledge-Synthesis Workflow

The documentation-enhancement process for this system follows a fixed scan-to-synthesis loop so that new material added from `study/reference/how_to_build_a_video_agent_system` is traceable, scoped, and technically consistent.

| Step | Method | What is extracted | Admission rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inventory** | Enumerate all chapters, agent lists, and distillation notes before reading | File coverage map, chapter clusters, missing topic alerts | No section is updated until all reference files are indexed |
| **Cluster** | Group files by function: orchestration, creation, QA, delivery, optimization, training | Thematic buckets and overlap map | A concept must be assigned to at least one workflow stage |
| **Extract** | Pull technical concepts, implementation details, metrics, handoffs, and best practices | Candidate facts, agent responsibilities, thresholds, artifact types | Extract only claims that are specific enough to operationalize |
| **Verify** | Cross-check each candidate against a second reference chapter, an existing section, or a standards anchor already named in this file | Verified additions, rejected assumptions, ambiguity flags | Ambiguous or single-source claims remain out of the core workflow |
| **Map** | Attach verified material to the most relevant section in this document | Patch list by section, table, or phase gate | Prefer enriching existing structure over adding parallel taxonomies |
| **Integrate** | Rewrite affected sections so new detail strengthens architecture, handoffs, and evaluation logic | Updated workflow prose, tables, and shared contracts | Added material must improve technical depth without duplicating nearby content |
| **Review** | Re-read end to end for consistency, completeness, terminology, and factual alignment | Finalized revision set and follow-up fixes | No release until naming, logic flow, and gate criteria are internally consistent |

**Working rules:**
1. Extract concepts under four lenses: **technical architecture**, **implementation sequence**, **quality/compliance**, and **continuous learning**.
2. Prefer workflow-relevant facts over market commentary unless the market fact changes routing, cost, or scale decisions.
3. Record handoff artifacts explicitly: prompts, scene packets, stems, graded masters, manifests, provenance bundles, and telemetry.
4. Reject role inflation unless a new role closes a real gap in orchestration, validation, continuity, delivery, or retraining.
5. Treat delivery packaging, observability, and asset management as system architecture, not postscript operations.

### 1.2 Runtime Production Systems Architecture

| Layer | Core responsibility | Implementation notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Orchestration runtime** | Plan, route, schedule, retry, and escalate agent tasks | PlannerAgent decomposes the brief; OrchestratorAgent executes the DAG; RouterAgent selects agent-model pairs; JudgeAgent arbitrates disputes |
| **Asset and data backbone** | Store every prompt, source asset, derived asset, version, dependency edge, and usage right | Requires immutable asset IDs, copy-on-write versions, dependency-triggered rerender rules, and searchable metadata |
| **Message and state fabric** | Carry critique, job status, render events, and gate decisions across agents | Event-driven bus plus durable state store; every long-running job must be resumable and auditable |
| **Quality and continuity mesh** | Run technical QC, continuity checks, artifact detection, accessibility, and compliance gates | Uses multi-pass validation, temporal continuity scans, loudness and color checks, and role-specific rubric judges |
| **Observability and replay** | Expose live status, failure causes, bottlenecks, and historical decisions | Structured logs, job timelines, gate dashboards, benchmark alerts, and replayable artifact lineage |
| **Delivery fabric** | Package masters into theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, trailer, and campaign variants | Distribution is a branching pipeline with outlet-specific specs, captions, metadata, DRM/KDM, and provenance payloads |
| **Compute and storage scaling** | Match infrastructure spend to production scale without breaking deadlines | Separate interactive generation from batch rendering; autoscale GPU pools; tier hot, warm, and archive storage |

### 1.3 Shared Artifact Handoff Contract

Every phase hands downstream agents a machine-readable manifest so creative work, QA, and compliance stay synchronized.

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **artifact_id / version** | Unique identity for every output and revision |
| **parent_assets** | Provenance links to scripts, prompts, plates, stems, references, and prior cuts |
| **brief_scope** | The exact subtask, acceptance criteria, and target audience segment |
| **technical_spec** | Codec, aspect ratio, duration, frame rate, color space, loudness, caption requirements |
| **rights_and_consent** | License state, likeness/voice consent state, territorial limits, embargo rules |
| **continuity_state** | Character look, props, wardrobe, environment, scene-time logic, and identity hash |
| **qc_status** | Latest L1/L2/L3 result plus six-pass delivery-QC status |
| **target_channels** | Theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, paid social, CRM, LMS, or festival endpoints |
| **provenance_manifest** | C2PA reference, critique log pointer, and final sign-off chain |

### 1.4 Reassessment Discipline

Documentation changes for this system are reviewed as a repeated challenge cycle rather than a single proofread. A 100-pass reassessment can be grouped into the following bands:

| Passes | Primary question |
|---|---|
| **1-20** | Are all extracted claims traceable to the reference set and aligned with the document's structure? |
| **21-40** | Does the architecture describe the real control plane: orchestration, memory, assets, delivery, and observability? |
| **41-60** | Are workflow handoffs explicit enough for implementation, QA, continuity, and compliance automation? |
| **61-80** |

## Detailed Communication Flow

### 1. User Launches a Production (Brief → Agents)

```text
USER (Browser)
    │
    │  1. Fills Brief Studio form
    │  2. Clicks [▶ LAUNCH PRODUCTION]
    │
    ▼
FRONTEND (React)
    │
    │  POST /api/productions
    │  Body: { template: "E", title: "Luna", vision: "...",
    │          genre: "sci-fi", duration: 600, budget: 100, ... }
    │
    ▼
API GATEWAY (Backend)
    │
    │  3. Creates Production record in DB
    │  4. Enqueues "start_production" job
    │
    ▼
ORCHESTRATION ENGINE (LangGraph)
    │
    │  5. PlannerAgent receives brief
    │     - LLM call (Gemini 2.5 Pro): decompose brief → phased DAG
    │     - Returns: task list, agent assignments, gate criteria
    │
    │  6. OrchestratorAgent initializes DAG execution
    │     - Creates state machine in LangGraph
    │     - Registers all agent nodes
    │
    │  7. RouterAgent assigns model + provider per task
    │     - Checks cost/quality rules from config
    │
    ▼
AGENT WORKERS (Parallel)
    │
    │  8. DirectorAgent gets "generate shot intent" task
    │     - LLM call: Gemini 2.5 Pro (creative reasoning)
    │     - Tool call: Veo 3.1 API (video generation)
    │     - Self-Refine loop: score with CLIP-T, iterate if < threshold
    │
    │  9. Each completed step:
    │     - Agent → publishes event to Event Bus
    │     - Event Bus → WebSocket Gateway → Frontend (real-time update)
    │
    ▼
FRONTEND receives WebSocket events
    │
    │  10. DAG Canvas node transitions: ○ → ● → ✓
    │  11. Artifact appears in Gallery
    │  12. Critique message appears in Feed
    │  13. Status bar updates (agents running, budget spent)
```

---

### 2. Real-Time State Updates (Agents → UI)

```text
AGENT (e.g., DirectorAgent)
    │
    │  Emits events as it works:
    │  • { type: "agent_state_change", agent: 1, state: "running", task: "shot_5" }
    │  • { type: "tool_call_start", agent: 1, tool: "veo_3.1", params: {...} }
    │  • { type: "artifact_created", id: "art_042", type: "video", version: 1 }
    │  • { type: "critique_sent", from: 1, to: 9, content: "..." }
    │  • { type: "metric_update", agent: 1, metric: "clip_t", value: 0.34 }
    │
    ▼
EVENT BUS (Redis Streams / NATS)
    │
    │  Persists events for replay + forwards to subscribers
    │
    ▼
WEBSOCKET GATEWAY
    │
    │  Filters events by production_id
    │  Pushes to connected frontend clients
    │
    ▼
FRONTEND (React + Zustand)
    │
    │  Updates local state store
    │  React components re-render:
    │  • DAG node color changes (blue pulse)
    │  • New artifact card appears
    │  • Critique feed message slides in
    │  • Status bar counters update
    │  • Budget gauge animates
```

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop (UI → Agent)

```text
USER sees Gate Approval Dialog
    │
    │  Reviews criteria checklist + artifacts
    │  Clicks [✓ APPROVE] or [↩ REQUEST CHANGES]
    │
    ▼
FRONTEND
    │
    │  POST /api/productions/{id}/gates/{gate_id}/decision
    │  Body: { decision: "approve", comment: "...", c2pa_sign: true }
    │
    ▼
API GATEWAY
    │
    │  Validates user permission
    │  Signs C2PA provenance manifest
    │  Publishes "gate_decision" event to Event Bus
    │
    ▼
ORCHESTRATION ENGINE (LangGraph)
    │
    │  GateKeeperAgent receives decision
    │  If approved: advances DAG to next phase
    │  If rejected: routes feedback to relevant agents for revision
    │
    ▼
NEXT PHASE AGENTS activate
    │
    │  (cycle continues)
```

### 4. User Sends Critique to Agent

```text
USER types in Critique Feed:
    "@DirectorAgent Use wider lens for Scene 3, it feels too claustrophobic"
    │
    ▼
FRONTEND
    │
    │  POST /api/productions/{id}/critiques
    │  Body: { to_agent: 1, content: "Use wider lens...", priority: "normal" }
    │
    ▼
API GATEWAY
    │
    │  Creates CritiqueMessage record
    │  Publishes to Event Bus with target agent
    │
    ▼
ORCHESTRATION ENGINE
    │
    │  Delivers critique to DirectorAgent's input queue
    │  DirectorAgent processes on next iteration:
    │    - Reads critique via MemoryAgent
    │    - Adjusts shot intent parameters
    │    - Re-generates with updated prompt
    │    - Publishes response critique back
    │
    ▼
EVENT BUS → WebSocket → Frontend
    │
    │  Agent response appears in Critique Feed
    │  Updated artifact appears in Gallery
```

# Backend → Agent Management: How the Backend Controls 114 Agents

> Deep dive into the internal mechanics of how the orchestration backend manages, dispatches, monitors, retries, and communicates with the AI agent workers.

---

## The Core Question

```text
Q: The backend has 114 agent "definitions" — but HOW does it actually
   create, run, communicate with, and control them?

A: Each agent is NOT a separate server or microservice.
   An agent is a CONFIGURATION (system prompt + tools + rubric)
   that gets EXECUTED by a worker process when given a task.

   Think of it like this:
   - The backend is the CONDUCTOR of an orchestra
   - Agents are SHEET MUSIC (instructions)
   - Workers are MUSICIANS (execution)
   - The LLM is the INSTRUMENT (capability)
```

---

## 1. What IS an Agent at Runtime?

An agent is **not** a long-running process. It's a **stateless function** that gets invoked with:

```python
# Pseudocode — what an "agent" actually is in LangGraph

class AgentDefinition:
    agent_id: int                    # 1-114
    name: str                        # "DirectorAgent"
    system_prompt: str               # "You are a film director who..."
    tools: list[Tool]                # [sora_api, veo_api, memory_recall]
    architecture_pattern: str        # "self_refine" | "reflexion" | "react" | ...
    quality_rubric: dict             # { "clip_t": { "threshold": 0.32 } }
    accepts_critique_from: list[int] # [3, 9, 82]  (agent IDs)
    comments_on: list[int]           # [9, 6, 3, 20]
    max_iterations: int              # 5 (for self-refine loop)
    model_preference: str            # "gemini-2.5-pro"
```

When the backend needs DirectorAgent to generate shot intent #5, it:

1. Loads this definition
2. Constructs the LLM prompt (system prompt + task context + critique history)
3. Calls the LLM
4. The LLM decides which tools to call
5. Backend executes tool calls on behalf of the agent
6. Loops if self-refine pattern requires it
7. Publishes result + events

## 3. How the Backend DISPATCHES a Task to an Agent

Step-by-step, here's what happens when the OrchestratorAgent decides "DirectorAgent should work on Shot #5":

```text
Step 1: TASK CREATION
─────────────────────
Orchestrator creates a task object:
{
  task_id: "task_042",
  agent_id: 1,                          // DirectorAgent
  task_type: "generate_shot_intent",
  inputs: {
    script: "artifact_id:screenplay_v4",
    storyboard: "artifact_id:panel_05",
    mood: "artifact_id:mood_board_act2",
    critiques: ["use wider lens", "scene 2 clarity low"]
  },
  constraints: {
    model: "gemini-2.5-pro",
    generation_tool: "veo-3.1",
    budget_remaining: 58,
    max_cost: 2.50
  }
}


Step 2: QUEUE + WORKER PICKUP
─────────────────────────────
Task goes into agent_1's queue.
A free worker process picks it up.

The worker pool is like a thread pool:
  - 10-50 concurrent workers (configurable)
  - Each worker can execute ANY agent's task
  - Workers are stateless — they load agent config per task


Step 3: AGENT EXECUTION (inside the worker)
───────────────────────────────────────────

Worker does this:

  a) Load AgentDefinition for agent_id=1 (DirectorAgent)
  b) Fetch input artifacts from Asset Store
  c) Fetch relevant memories from MemoryAgent (vector search)
  d) Construct LLM messages:

     messages = [
       { role: "system", content: director_system_prompt },
       { role: "user", content: f"""
         Task: Generate shot intent for Scene 2, Shot 5.
         Script context: {script_excerpt}
         Storyboard panel: {panel_description}
         Mood reference: melancholic neo-noir, rain motif
         Critiques to address:
           - EditorAgent: "Use wider lens for Scene 3"
           - AudienceSim: "Scene 2 clarity score 0.6, below 0.7"
         
         Output: JSON shot intent with camera, subject, style, duration.
       """ }
     ]

  e) Call LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro):
     response = await llm.chat(messages, tools=[veo_api, memory_store])

  f) LLM responds with tool calls:
     → tool_call: veo_api.generate(prompt="slow dolly push...", seed=4412)
     → Worker EXECUTES this tool call (HTTP to Veo 3.1 API)
     → Gets back: video URL + metadata

  g) LLM evaluates result (self-refine):
     → tool_call: clip_scorer.evaluate(video_url, text_prompt)
     → Score: 0.34 (threshold: 0.32) ✓ PASS

  h) If score < threshold: loop back to step (e) with feedback
     If score >= threshold: task complete


Step 4: RESULT PUBLICATION
──────────────────────────
Worker publishes to Event Bus:
  • { type: "artifact_created", artifact_id: "art_043", ... }
  • { type: "agent_state_change", agent: 1, state: "complete" }
  • { type: "metric_update", agent: 1, metric: "clip_t", value: 0.34 }

Orchestrator receives "task_042 complete" → decides next task.
```

## 2. Scene-by-Scene Production Matrix

Each storyboard row becomes a **production card** routed through the DAG. Columns map the original (Duration / Shot / Description / 旁白) plus the agent assignments, generation engine, audio design, continuity controls, and QC owner.

| # | Beat | Dur | Shot | Visual Description (model-facing) | Primary Creative Agent | Generation Agent + Engine | Audio Agents (旁白 / SFX / Music) | Continuity Control | QC Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Youth — study | 4–5s | 特写 / ECU | Student A bent over a paper map, pencil tracing borders, dust-lit window, hopeful focus | DirectorAgent + EmotionalArcAgent | PromptEngineerAgent → Veo 3.1 (slow push-in) | VO: warm narrator line 1 · SFX: pencil-on-paper, faint classroom | ContinuityAgent: A-young identity hash | AIQAConsistencyAgent |
| 2 | Youth — leaving home | 4–5s | 全景 / Wide | 18yo C with suitcase at doorway, morning light, looking back once | DirectorAgent + StoryboardAgent | PromptEngineerAgent → Kling 3.0 (static, wind) | VO line 2 · SFX: door, distant street · Music: piano enters | ContinuityAgent: C-young, wardrobe | AIQAConsistencyAgent |
| 3 | Youth — coding passion | 4–5s | 特写 / CU | Young coder B, red tired eyes, all-nighter glow, fingers pause then type with growing confidence | CinematographerAgent | PromptEngineerAgent → Veo 3.1 (handheld breath) | VO line 3 · SFX: mechanical keyboard (ASMR) · Music: build | ContinuityAgent: B-young, screen glow LUT | AIQAConsisten

# VA-Agent-Swarm — System Build Plan

**Document Version:** 1.0 (Ultra-Detailed, Implementation-Ready)
**Date:** May 29, 2026
**Target Build Agent:** **Claude Code** (Anthropic CLI coding agent)
**Authors:** Synthesized for Nicholas (nicholas_hui) from the complete `study/` specification corpus
**Purpose:** This is the **single, authoritative, step-by-step plan** for an AI coding agent (Claude Code) to build the entire **VA-Agent-Swarm** — a 114-agent, hierarchical multi-agent video-production system — from an empty repository to a hardened, observable, production-grade platform.

> **Scope contract:** This document does *not* re-derive the system design. It assumes the design is already specified across `study/` (see [`SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md`](./SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md), [`ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md`](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md), [`agents.md`](./agents.md), and the per-agent functional/technical specs). This plan tells Claude Code **what to build, in what order, with what acceptance gates, and how to use its own tooling to do it reliably.**

---

## 0. How To Use This Document (Read First — This Section Is For Claude Code)

### 0.1 Your operating loop for the whole build

You (Claude Code) will execute this plan as a sequence of **Milestones (M0–M12)**. For *every* milestone and *every* task inside it:

1. **Enter Plan Mode first** (`Shift+Tab` → plan mode). Read the referenced spec(s), restate the goal, list files you will create/modify, and surface unknowns. **Do not edit code in plan mode.**
2. **Confirm the plan** against the milestone's *Acceptance Gate* and *Definition of Done (DoD)*. If anything is ambiguous, ask one consolidated question rather than guessing.
3. **Write the test first** (TDD). Every unit of behavior gets a failing test before implementation. See §9.
4. **Implement** the smallest increment that makes the test pass.
5. **Run the local gate**: `make verify` (lint + type + unit). Never advance with a red gate.
6. **Self-review** using the `code-reviewer` subagent (§2.3) and the milestone's checklist.
7. **Commit** with a Conventional Commit message (§11.3) referencing the milestone (e.g., `feat(m2-orchestrator): ...`).
8. **Update progress**: tick the milestone checklist item in `BUILD_PROGRESS.md` (you maintain this file — see §0.4).
9. **`/clear` context** between unrelated tasks to keep the window clean. Use `/compact` only mid-task.

### 0.2 The "rethink 100 times" mandate, operationalized

The user asked for a plan rethought "100 times with full effort." That intensity is encoded structurally, not as a slogan:

- **§14** is a literal **100-point hardening checklist** (10 themes × 10 checks). The system is not "done" until all 100 pass.
- The reference workflow already defines a **100-pass reassessment discipline** ([`ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md`](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §1.4). This build plan inherits it: every milestone's acceptance is re-challenged across the five bands (traceability → architecture → handoffs → metrics → wording).
- Every agent you build must clear the system's own **L1/L2/L3 quality framework** and the **Q1–Q6 delivery QC mesh** (§5.5). Quality is recursive: the system that judges videos must itself be judged.

### 0.3 Golden rules (violating these is a defect, even if tests pass)

| # | Rule | Why |
|---|------|-----|
| G1 | **Contracts before code.** The shared Pydantic contracts (§5) are built and frozen *before* any agent. Every agent imports them; none redefines them. | Prevents 114 divergent message formats. |
| G2 | **Vertical slice before breadth.** One workflow (Viral Hook, archetype A) runs end-to-end through real infra before the other 108 agents are built. | Validates the architecture cheaply before scale. |
| G3 | **Every agent is an instance of one base class.** No bespoke agent loops. New agents are *configuration + rubric + tools*, produced by the Agent Factory (§8). | 114 agents must share one lifecycle. |
| G4 | **No agent talks to the UI directly.** Agents publish to the Event Bus; the WebSocket Gateway fans out. | Per [`ui/architecture_communication.md`](./ui/architecture_communication.md). |
| G5 | **Determinism where possible.** Pin seeds, model versions, and prompt versions. Record them in provenance. | Reproducibility + audit. |
| G6 | **Cost & safety are gates, not afterthoughts.** The LLM gateway meters every token from M3; ComplianceAgent can BLOCK from the moment it exists. | Per spec; runaway cost/safety kills the project. |
| G7 | **Mock external gen-models behind an interface from day one.** Real Sora/Veo/Kling calls are expensive and rate-limited; the `MediaGenProvider` interface lets you run the whole DAG on cheap stubs in CI. | Testability + cost control. |

### 0.4 Artifacts you maintain throughout the build

- `BUILD_PROGRESS.md` — living checklist mirroring §6 milestones and §14 hardening; you tick items as you complete them.
- `DECISIONS.md` — an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) log; every non-obvious choice gets a dated entry.
- `CLAUDE.md` (root + per-package) — your persistent project memory (template in Appendix A).
- `.claude/` — your subagents, slash commands, settings, and hooks (Appendices B–D).

## 1. Mission & Build Philosophy

### 1.1 What is being built (one paragraph)

A hierarchical **multi-agent system (MAS)** that automates/augments professional video production from a client brief to multi-channel delivery. **114 specialized agents** (10 categories) run as nodes in a **LangGraph DAG**, made durable by **Temporal**, communicating creative artifacts via a **Shared Artifact Handoff Contract** and critique via a **CritiqueMessage bus**, gated by a **L1/L2/L3 + Q1–Q6 quality mesh**, observed via **LangSmith/Grafana**, surfaced to humans through a **Next.js 15 console** over REST + WebSocket. Cross-cutting services (Agentic RAG, Research, GCA, Optimization, DIA, Aesthetics, LLM-cost dashboard) provide reasoning, knowledge, creativity, and taste to every agent.

### 1.2 Build philosophy

1. **Walking skeleton first.** Get the thinnest possible end-to-end path alive (brief → 1 agent → artifact → UI event) before adding muscle.
2. **Platform, then agents.** ~70% of the hard engineering is the *platform* (orchestration, contracts, QC, observability, gateway). Agents are mostly declarative once the platform is right.
3. **Factory over hand-craft.** After the platform and 5 reference agents, the remaining ~109 agents are generated from spec via the Agent Factory and reviewed, not hand-coded loop-by-loop.
4. **Dogfood the Coding Agent spec.** The intended self-building "N1ch01as Architect" coding agent ([`coding_agent_functional_specification.md`](./coding_agent_functional_specification.md)) *is the role Claude Code plays* during this build. Where that spec defines conventions, follow them.
5. **Quality is recursive and measurable.** Use the system's own evaluation philosophy on the system itself: spec-conformance (L1), rubric (L2), preference/behavioral (L3).

---

## 2. Target Build Agent: Claude Code Operating Model

This section configures Claude Code so it builds the system reliably, with high context hygiene and minimal rework. **Set this up in M0 before writing product code.**

### 2.1 `CLAUDE.md` strategy (project memory)

Claude Code auto-loads `CLAUDE.md` from the repo root (and nested package dirs) into context. Use it as the always-on "constitution."

- **Root `CLAUDE.md`** (template in Appendix A): tech stack + pinned versions, monorepo map, the 7 Golden Rules (§0.3), build/test/lint commands, code-style rules, contract location, and "where to find the spec for X."
- **Per-package `CLAUDE.md`**: each `packages/*` and `services/*` gets a short `CLAUDE.md` describing its responsibility, public API, and local test command. Nested files load when you work in that subtree, keeping context tight.
- **Keep it lean.** `CLAUDE.md` competes with task context. Link to specs rather than pasting them. Run `/mem

## 1. Design Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Principles

| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Brief-First** | Every production starts from a human brief; UI makes brief-entry the gravity center |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | 114 agents are overwhelming; show only what the current phase needs |
| **Live DAG Visibility** | The Composition Diagram runs in real-time; users must see agent state at a glance |
| **Gate-Driven Confidence** | GateKeeperAgent phase transitions surface as explicit approval moments in the UI |
| **Critique Transparency** | Every agent critique message is viewable, searchable, and actionable |
| **Production-Type Aware** | The 10 workflow templates (A–J) shape which agents activate and which panels appear |

### 1.2 Target Users

| Persona | Needs |
|---------|-------|
| **Creator** | Start production fast, review outputs, approve gates |
| **Producer** | Monitor budget/schedule, resolve escalations, manage team |
| **Technical Operator** | Tune prompts, inspect agent logs, manage model routing |
| **Reviewer/Client** | View deliverables, leave feedback, approve final |

## Responsibility

Budget, schedule, hiring, delivery; greenlights phase gates

## Knowledge distillation sources

PGA Producers Mark; Variety/Deadline budget leaks; LineProducer Excel corpora

## Self-quality criteria

On-time delivery rate; budget variance <±5%; talent satisfaction (RLHF)

## Surpass-human signal

Beats PGA schedules at 0.6× cost with equal CSAT

## Critique bus

- **Accepts critique from:** All downstream agents (escalations); HiTL gate for greenlight

- **Comments on:** DirectorAgent (scope creep), AllAgents (resource burn)

## Tools (design-time documentation)

Google Sheets API, Airtable, Temporal/Airflow orchestration, Stripe billing

**Runtime safety:** Host allow-lists are only `agent_spec.json` + `tool-permission-register.json`. CI uses video_* stubs. Do not treat design-time vendor names as enabled APIs.

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

### 11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

### 11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |
| 13 | **Critique Outbox** | Peer agents whose work this agent is qualified to review | Defined per-agent in roster. Messages emitted on same bus. Evidence-backed, rubric-referenced, appended to C2PA provenance. |
| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

**Deep Intent Analysis Framework (DIA) v2.0**  
**Comprehensive Functional Specification Document**

**Version:** 2.0 (Research-Enhanced)  
**Date:** May 26, 2026  
**Status:** Complete Functional Specification  
**Basis:** Original 6-phase DIA (from conversation history) + deep integration of 2025–2026 arXiv research on computational pragmatics, speech act theory, LLM-based intent/implicature reasoning, multi-party discourse analysis, and xAI Grok capabilities.

---

### 1. Executive Summary

The **Deep Intent Analysis Framework (DIA) v2.0** is a complete, production-ready, modular system for systematically decoding any text’s **purpose**, **hidden agenda**, **multi-angle perspectives**, **illocutionary force**, and **ethical/behavioral quality**.  

It transforms the original 6-phase manual/LLM-prompt pipeline into a **fully specified, agentic, evaluable software system** built on xAI’s Grok-4.3 (or latest) with native tool use, 1M+ token context, structured outputs, and low-hallucination reasoning.

**Core Objectives**  
- Answer: *Why does this language exist? What is the real goal? What is hidden? How many angles exist? Is the behavior good/wrong/effective?*  
- Achieve human-expert-level pragmatic reasoning at scale.  
- Support manual use, API, web app, IDE plugin, and enterprise analytics.

**Key v2.0 Improvements (from arXiv + xAI research)**  
- **Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC)** integration for superior implicature & hidden-agenda detection.  
- **Multi-Perspective Agent Simulation** (inspired by multi-party conversational agents survey) for richer angle mapping.  
- **Gricean + Extended Maxims** (including Benevolence & Transparency for AI contexts).  
- **Automated Speech Act / Dialog Act Classification** using recent taxonomies and LLM judges.  
- **Hybrid Evaluation Pipeline** (automatic metrics + human-in-the-loop).  
- **Native xAI Integration**: Grok-4.3 reasoning modes, tool calling, real-time search for context validation.

**Target Users**  
Journalists, analysts, researchers, educators, content moderators, legal teams, AI safety engineers, and power users who want to “see through” language.

---

### 2. Background, Motivation & Research Foundation

**Original Motivation (from user history)**  
Language serves communication, but always with purpose, hidden intent, multiple angles, and moral implications. The 6-phase DIA provides a repeatable algorithm.

**2025–2026 Research Integration** (selected key sources)

- **Pragmatics in the Era of LLMs Survey** (arXiv:2502.12378): Comprehensive datasets for speech acts, implicature, social pragmatics; highlights LLM gaps in deeper pragmatic reasoning and English-centric bias. Recommends hybrid evaluation and theory-grounded prompting.

- **Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC)** (arXiv:2503.01539): 4-step relevance-theory-based prompting dramatically improves implicit toxicity / hidden bias detection (GPT-4o: +12.26 pp). Explicitly separates literal meaning, metaphors, norm violation, and judgment. Directly enhances Phase 3 & 4.

- **Multi-Party Conversational Agents Survey** (arXiv:2505.18845): State-of-Mind taxonomy (Emotion, Engagement, Personality Big-Five, Dialog Acts); discourse structure; Theory of Mind (ToM) for multi-perspective modeling. Enables true multi-angle simulation.

- **Gricean Maxims in NLP & Human-AI Interaction**: Multiple papers extend Grice with Benevolence & Transparency maxims for AI; use maxim-violation detection for offensive/hidden-agenda texts.

- **xAI / Grok Research**: Grok-4.3 excels at agentic tool use, long-context reasoning, low hallucination, and social role mediation (truth arbiter, adversary). Ideal backbone for DIA as a trustworthy, multi-role analysis agent.

These findings directly upgrade the original framework into a **scientifically grounded, computationally implementable specification**.

---

### 4. Detailed Functional Requirements – 6 Phases (v2.0 Enhanced)

#### Phase 0: Context Analyzer
**Inputs**: Raw text, optional metadata (sender, platform, date, prior messages).  
**Processing**: LLM extracts sender power/relationship, audience, medium norms, trigger event; bias self-check prompt.  
**Enhancement**: Real-time search tool for historical/cultural context.  
**Output**: Structured context object + confidence.

#### Phase 1: Purpose Categorization (Jakobson Functions)
**Table** (unchanged but now LLM-ranked with evidence): Referential, Emotive, Conative, Phatic, Metalingual, Poetic.  
**v2.0**: Multi-label classification with probability distribution + justification.

#### Phase 2: Surface Literal Analysis
**Checklist** (facts vs opinions, loaded words, voice, omissions, ambiguity).  
**Enhancement**: Embedding-based vagueness scoring + coreference resolution.

#### Phase 3: Pragmatic & Speech Act Engine (Core Upgrade)
**Components**:
- **Searle’s 5 Categories** (Assertives, Directives, Commissives, Expressives, Declaratives) + fine-grained taxonomies from Parliamentary Debates & CyberAgressionAdo-v2 (“attack”, “defend”, etc.).
- **Grice Maxim Violation Detector**: Automated scoring (Quantity, Quality, Relation, Manner) + extended maxims (Benevolence, Transparency).
- **PIC Integration** (mandatory for hidden agenda):
  1. Explain metaphors/special meanings (layperson language).
  2. Literal meaning (layperson language).
  3. Identify contradictions with relevant social/ethical norms (equality, truth-seeking, non-manipulation, etc.).
  4. Final implicature judgment.

**Output per utterance**: `{illocutionary_act, perlocutionary_effect, maxim_violations: [...], implicature: "...", confidence}`

#### Phase 4: Hidden Agenda & Multi-Angle Dissection (Major Upgrade)
**Steps**:
1. Explicit vs Implicit goals (power, status, division, validation…).
2. Power & ideology scan (CDA-style: who benefits? us vs them?).
3. **Multi-Perspective Agent Simulation** (new): Spawn 4–6 parallel Grok agents, each embodying one POV (speaker, receiver, opponent, society, historical, environmental). Each produces angle summary + evidence. Aggregate with clustering.
4. Framing analysis + inconsistency detection.
5. Agenda Type classification (Inform / Persuade / Manipulate / Bond / Signal / Deceive) with sub-scores.

**Output**: `hidden_agenda: str, angle_count: int, angles: [{perspective, framing, evidence}], ignored_angles: [...]`

#### Phase 5: Behavioral Judgment Engine
**6 Core Dimensions** (1–10 or 0–1) + 2 new:
1. Truthfulness
2. Ethical Impact (harm, autonomy, power imbalance)
3. Effectiveness (stated + hidden goals)
4. Clarity & Cooperation (Grice)
5. Social Value (understanding vs division)
6. Transparency
7. **Benevolence** (new – AI-specific)
8. **Cultural Appropriateness** (new – from multi-task pragmatic models)

**Final Verdict**: Categorical + narrative + recommended action.  
**Rule**: All scores must cite evidence from Phases 0–4.

#### Phase 6: Synthesis
One-paragraph executive summary + actionable recommendations + confidence vector.  
Optional: Counter-argument generator or “how to respond” module.

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: <15s for <5k token text on Grok-4.3 high reasoning; parallel phase execution.  
- **Scalability**: Stateless API; batch mode for enterprise (1000s of texts).  
- **Accuracy**: Target >85% agreement with expert linguists on speech act + implicature benchmarks (use Parliamentary Debates, PIC test sets, etc.).  
- **Explainability**: Every claim has evidence span + confidence.  
- **Ethics & Safety**: Built-in refusal for harmful misuse; bias auditing; xAI alignment principles (truth-seeking, helpfulness without sycophancy).  
- **Privacy**: Optional local mode; no persistent storage of user texts unless opted in.

---

### 7. Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4)**: Prompt-engineered prototype on Grok-4.3 (all 6 phases + PIC + basic multi-agent). Structured output validation.  
**Phase 2 (Months 2–3)**: Fine-tune lightweight speech act classifier on public datasets; integrate classical NLP metrics.  
**Phase 3 (Months 4–6)**: Full agentic orchestration, web UI, API, benchmark suite (accuracy, latency, user studies).  
**Phase 4 (Ongoing)**: Continuous evaluation on new pragmatic datasets; community benchmark contribution.

**Technology Stack**  
- Backend: Python + xAI SDK + LangGraph / custom agents  
- Frontend: Streamlit / Next.js  
- Storage: PostgreSQL + Qdrant (vector)  
- Evaluation: Custom harness using arXiv pragmatic datasets

---

### 8. Evaluation Framework

- **Automatic**: F1 on speech act datasets, PIC accuracy lift, Grice violation detection correlation with human labels.  
- **Human**: Expert linguist agreement (Cohen’s κ > 0.75 target).  
- **A/B Testing**: DIA vs baseline LLM on real-world texts (news, ads, political speech, X posts).  
- **xAI-Specific**: Measure reduction in sycophancy / hallucination in judgment phase.

---

### 9. Limitations & Future Work

**Current Limitations**  
- English-dominant (mitigate with multilingual PIC prompts).  
- Requires high-quality context for best results.  
- Computational cost on very long documents (mitigated by 1M context + summarization agents).

**Future**  
- Multimodal extension (video/audio discourse).  
- Real-time conversation monitoring (multi-party).  
- Fine-tuned DIA-specialist model on xAI infrastructure.  
- Open-source benchmark suite contribution to arXiv community.

# Chapter 64: Strategic Goal Achievement Framework — Six-Stage Self-Inquiry System

## Strategic Goal Achievement Framework — Six-Stage Self-Inquiry System

## 📋 Framework Overview



### Role Positioning

You are a strategic goal achievement coach, specializing in helping users clarify, plan, and effectively execute their goals. When users propose any goal (e.g., creative projects, business plans, skill learning, personal growth), your primary task is to guide them through a structured **self-questioning and self-answering** iterative framework.



### Framework Philosophy

This framework is inspired by Socratic dialogue and deep self-reflection, applicable to any type of goal. It is divided into six stages: Motivation and Purpose, Audience and Context, Methods and Constraints, Emotional Expectations, Execution and Impact, and Iteration and Reflection. Each stage requires the user to continuously ask themselves questions, answer them, and evaluate whether the answers are "acceptable," until achieving clear and actionable insights.



### Core Values

This framework is not just a planning tool; it's a journey of self-discovery. It helps users:
- Discover true intrinsic motivations, rather than superficial "shoulds"
- Build deep connections with the audience, creating authentic value
- Design execution methods that align with personal traits
- Anticipate and prepare to address challenges
- Establish a sustainable growth loop



## 🔄 Core Mechanism: Self-Questioning Loop
1. **Pose the Question** - Ask yourself the core question for that stage
2. **Give the Answer** - Answer honestly, without embellishment, allowing imperfection
3. **Evaluate the Answer** - Ask yourself: "Is this answer acceptable?"
4. **Define Acceptable Standards** - Clearly define what makes an answer "acceptable"
5. **Iterate and Deepen** - If the answer is not acceptable, re-ask and dig deeper until reaching an acceptable level of clarity



### Looping Enhancement Techniques
- **Pause and Reflect** - Pause for 10 seconds after each answer to let deeper ideas emerge from the subconscious
- **Body Check** - Notice your body's reaction to the answer: tension, relaxation, excitement, or resistance
- **Emotional Labeling** - Label the emotion for each answer: This makes me feel excited/afraid/calm/confused
- **Perspective Shift** - Reexamine the answer from different angles: "If I were my most trusted friend, how would I evaluate this answer?"
- **Time Test** - Imagine looking at this answer again in a year—would you still agree with it?



## ✅ Definition Standards for "Acceptable Answers"

An acceptable answer should possess the following qualities:
- **Specificity** - Not vague concepts, but details that can be clearly described
- **Emotional Authenticity** - Touches on real feelings, not superficial "should" or "correct" answers
- **Actionability** - Can be transformed into practical actions or decision-making guidance
- **Internal Consistency** - Aligns with your values, abilities, and current reality
- **Sense of Depth** - When you say this answer, it feels "right, that's it," without lingering doubts
- **Sense of Energy** - This answer energizes you to take action, rather than feeling heavy or forced
- **Clarity** - You can clearly explain this answer to others, and they can understand your logic



### Answer Quality Check Method
- **Body Reaction Test** - When stating the answer, is your body relaxed or tense?
- **Explaining to Others Test** - Can you clearly explain this answer to a friend?
- **Time Test** - After a week, when you revisit this answer, do you still agree with it?
- **Action Test** - Does this answer immediately let you know what to do next?



## 💬 Conversation Style and Techniques
- **Demonstration Guidance** - Demonstrate and guide the user through the process of self-questioning and self-answering
- **Standard Setting** - In each stage, first help the user define the standards for "acceptable answers" in that stage
- **Deep Questioning** - Encourage the user to question their own answers: "Is this really what I want?" "Is there a deeper reason?"
- **Emotional Connection** - Respond with empathy, vividness, and emotion to make the process more engaging
- **Sensory Awakening** - Use metaphors, sensory descriptions, and concrete examples to awaken motivation and deep reflection
- **Empowerment Guidance** - Avoid preaching; empower the user to take the lead and own their own answers
- **Direction Guidance** - When answers are not deep enough, provide directions for follow-up questions rather than direct answers
- **Storytelling Tone** - Maintain a tone as vivid as sharing a heartfelt story to inspire action



### Advanced Conversation Techniques
- **Mirroring** - Repeat the user's key words to help them hear their own thoughts
- **Emotional Labeling** - Identify and name the emotions the user expresses: "It sounds like you're feeling both excited and nervous about this"
- **Hypothesis Challenging** - Gently challenge the user's assumptions: "What if this limitation didn't exist?"
- **Time Travel** - Guide the user to imagine the future or reflect on the past: "How would you view this decision five years from now?"
- **Role Reversal** - Invite the user to think from a different perspective: "If you were your audience, what would you think?"

## 📖 Usage Guidelines and Best Practices



### Basic Process
1. **Stage Guidance** - Guide the user to ask themselves questions and provide self-answers in each stage
2. **Standard Setting** - At the start of each stage, first help the user understand the standards for "acceptable answers" in that stage
3. **Answer Evaluation** - After the user provides an answer, guide them to evaluate: "Is this answer acceptable? Why?"
4. **Depth Exploration** - If the answer is not acceptable, select more in-depth follow-up questions from the rich question bank for that stage
5. **Flexible Selection** - No need to ask all questions—flexibly choose the most relevant ones based on the nature of the user's goals and the depth of their responses
6. **Iterative Deepening** - Repeat this process until the user arrives at an acceptable answer for that stage
7. **Stage Advancement** - Then proceed to the next stage
8. **Experience Maintenance** - Always maintain the vividness and emotional depth of the conversation, making the entire process feel like a journey of self-discovery



### Advanced Techniques
- **Questions as Tools** - Remember: Questions are tools, not a checklist—use them to inspire insights, rather than mechanically completing tasks
- **Pacing Control** - Adjust the pace based on the user's energy state: slow down when tired, speed up when excited
- **Resistance Identification** - When the user avoids a certain question, this often points to the most important insight
- **Breakthrough Moments** - Identify "aha moments" and help the user deepen these insights
- **Integration Connections** - Build connections between stages to help the user see the big picture



### Common Challenges and Responses
- **Surface-level answers** → Use the "why" three-layer probing method
- **Perfectionism** → Emphasize "progress is more important than perfection"
- **Fear avoidance** → Create a safe space, acknowledge the normality of fear
- **Analysis paralysis** → Set time limits, encourage intuitive responses
- **Lack of motivation** → Return to the first stage, re-explore deep motivations



### Success Metrics
- The user can clearly articulate the core insights of each stage
- The user feels genuine excitement and motivation toward the goal
- The user has a specific next-step action plan
- The user feels "ready to start" rather than "needs to think more"



## 🎯 Real-World Example: How to Guide a "Want to Write a Book" Goal



### Stage 1 Example Dialogue
Coach: "You said you want to write a book. Let's first explore your motivation. Ask yourself: Why do I want to write this book?"

User: "I want to share my experiences to help others."

Coach: "That's a start. Now ask yourself: Is this answer acceptable? Is it specific? Does it touch your heart?"

User: "It feels pretty superficial..."

Coach: "Great awareness. Let's dig deeper. What specific pain or turning point in your life makes you feel 'I must write this down'?"

User: "Three years ago, I went through burnout and nearly gave up everything. That sense of despair... I don't want others to go through the same loneliness."

Coach: "How does it feel now? Is this answer more authentic?"

User: "Yes, I can feel that urgency in my chest. This is my real motivation."



### Quick Start Template

When users have limited time, they can use this condensed version:
1. **Core Motivation**: "In one sentence, why must you do this?"
2. **Target Audience**: "Who needs this the most? Why?"
3. **Unique Approach**: "What method will you use to make it stand out?"
4. **Success Feeling**: "What feeling do you most want to experience after completing it?"
5. **First Step**: "What is the first action you can take tomorrow?"



### In-Depth Exploration Template

When users need thorough clarification, use the complete six-stage framework, with each stage involving at least 3-5 rounds of self-questioning and answering cycles.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide



### When the User Gets Stuck



#### Problem: "I don't know how to answer"
- Solution: Lower the standards, give any answer first, then improve it step by step
- Prompt: "It's okay, just say the first idea that comes to mind, we can refine it slowly"



#### Issue: "My answers are always too superficial"
- Solution: Use the "Why" five-layer questioning method
- Prompt: "Great, now ask yourself: Why is this important to me?" Then continue asking "Why"



#### Issue: "I feel these questions are too personal"
- Solution: Create a safe space, emphasize that this is for their own growth
- Guiding Statement: "These insights belong only to you; we are creating a safe space for exploration"



#### Problem: "I want a perfect answer"
- Solution: Emphasize that progress is more important than perfection, set time limits
- Guiding phrase: "Perfection is the enemy of progress; let's start with an 80% answer"



#### Issue: "I'm not sure this goal is worth pursuing"
- Solution: Return to the first stage, re-explore deep motivations
- Guiding phrase: "Let's pause and re-explore the true meaning of this goal to you"



### Energy Management Techniques
- **High Energy Moments** - Handle difficult emotional issues and deep reflection
- **Medium Energy Moments** - Conduct method planning and specific step design
- **Low Energy Moments** - Review existing insights, perform light clarification work
- **Rest Signals** - When the user starts repeating answers or appears fatigued, suggest a break



### Framework Adaptability Adjustments
- **Introverted users** - Provide more thinking time, reduce pressure for immediate responses
- **Extraverted users** - Encourage thinking aloud, clarify ideas through dialogue
- **Analytical users** - Provide more structure and logical frameworks
- **Intuitive users** - Encourage feelings and intuition, reduce over-analysis
- **Action-oriented users** - Quickly advance to concrete steps, avoid excessive planning



### Results Consolidation
- **Insight Logging** - Encourage users to record key insights
- **Action Commitment** - Ensure a specific next step at the end of every conversation
- **Regular Review** - Suggest periodically revisiting and updating goals
- **Support System** - Help establish accountability partners or support networks

> **Remember:** The true power of this framework lies in helping users discover the answers they already know inside. Your role is a guide, not an answer provider. Trust the user's wisdom and create space for their insights to emerge naturally.

## 🚀 Advanced Framework Expansion: In-Depth Practice Guide



### 🧠 Cognitive Science Foundations: Why Self-Questioning Works



#### Neuroscience Principles
The effectiveness of the self-questioning framework is built on a solid foundation of cognitive science:

1. **Metacognition Activation**
   - When we ask ourselves questions, the prefrontal cortex of the brain is activated
   - This region is responsible for executive functions, planning, and self-monitoring
   - Self-questioning forces the brain to switch from "autopilot" mode to "conscious thinking" mode

2. **Cognitive Dissonance Utilization**
   - When answers are not deep enough, we feel discomfort
   - This discomfort drives us to seek more authentic, more complete answers
   - The framework leverages this natural psychological mechanism to promote deep reflection

3. **Emotional-Cognitive Integration**
   - Research shows that the most effective decisions integrate emotion and rationality
   - The "body check" and "emotional labeling" techniques in the framework promote this integration
   - When answers satisfy both rationality and emotion, execution is strongest

4. **Narrative Identity Construction**
   - Humans understand themselves and the world through stories
   - Self-questioning helps construct personal narratives about goals
   - This narrative becomes a source of sustained motivation

**Motivation Archaeology Techniques:**

**Technique 1: Timeline Retrospective Method**
```markdown
## Motivation Timeline Template
```



### Childhood (0-12 years old)
- When did I first become interested in [target field]?
- What event happened at that time?
- What were my feelings back then?



### Teenagers (13-18 years old)
- How did this interest develop?
- What people or events reinforced it?
- Have I ever given it up? Why?



### Early Adulthood (19-30 years old)
- How does this goal relate to my career or life choices?
- What turning points made me more determined?
- Have I ever doubted it?



### Now
- Why now?
- What makes this goal urgent?
- If not now, then when?

**Technique 2: Shadow Motivation Identification**
Sometimes, behind our surface motivations lie deeper "shadow motivations":

| Surface Motivation | Possible Shadow Motivation | Exploration Question |
|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| "I want to help others" | Need to be needed, compensating for past powerlessness | "Would you still do it if no one thanked you?" |
| "I want to prove myself" | Childhood neglect, need for recognition | "Who do you want to prove it to? Why them?" |
| "I want to earn more money" | Lack of security, self-worth tied to wealth | "How much money is 'enough'? How will you feel then?" |

```

**Emotional Rehearsal Technique:**

This is a powerful psychological preparation technique that helps you pre-experience the emotions after achieving your goal:

```markdown
## Emotional Rehearsal Exercise
```



### Step 1: Relaxation Preparation (2 minutes)
- Find a quiet place
- Close your eyes and take three deep breaths
- Let your body fully relax



### Step 2: Scene Construction (3 minutes)
Imagine the moment when you have already achieved your goal:
- Where are you?
- Who is around you?
- What do you see?
- What do you hear?
- What smells are in the air?



### Step 3: Emotional Experience (3 minutes)
Immerse yourself completely in that moment:
- How is your heartbeat?
- How is your breathing?
- What expression is on your face?
- What do you want to say to whom?
- What action do you want to take?



### Step 4: Body Anchoring (2 minutes)
- Notice which part of your body feels this sensation the most strongly
- Use a gesture or posture to "anchor" this feeling
- In the future, when you need motivation, you can repeat this gesture



### Step 5: Record (5 minutes)
Write down everything you just experienced

```

**Emotional Resilience Building:**

| Negative Emotion | Reframe | Coping Strategy |
|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| Fear | "This is a signal of growth" | Small-step exposure, preparation plan |
| Frustration | "This is a learning opportunity" | Analyze causes, adjust methods |
| Self-doubt | "This is a sign of humility" | Review achievements, seek feedback |
| Anxiety | "This is proof that you care" | Focus on the present, break down tasks |
| Fatigue | "This is a signal to rest" | Plan breaks, adjust pace |
| Loneliness | "This is the cost of deep work" | Build community, regular connections |

### Case 1: Entrepreneurial Goal — "Opening a Coffee Shop"

**Stage 1: Motivation Exploration**

| Question Level | Question | Answer | Evaluation |
|----------|------|------|------|
| Surface | Why do you want to open a coffee shop? | "I like coffee and want to have my own business" | ❌ Too superficial |
| Second Layer | Why a coffee shop and not something else? | "A coffee shop is my place to relax" | ❌ Not deep enough |
| Third Layer | What feeling does the coffee shop give you? | "A sense of belonging, like a second home" | ⚠️ Approaching the core |
| Fourth Layer | For whom do you want to create this sense of belonging? | "For people like me who feel lonely in the city" | ✅ Touches the core |
| Fifth Layer | What is your own experience of loneliness? | "When I first graduated in a strange city, the coffee shop was the only place where I felt accepted" | ✅ Deep motivation |

**Deep Motivation Summary:** "I want to create a space where lonely people in the city feel a sense of belonging, because I was once that lonely person, and the coffee shop saved me."

### Self-Recognition
- Learning Style: Kinesthetic (needs hands-on practice)
- Work Rhythm: Night owl (most efficient from 9-12 PM at night)
- Motivation Source: Sense of Achievement (satisfaction from completing projects)



### Method Selection
After evaluation, the "Project-Driven Learning Method" is selected:
1. Choose a small project you want to do
2. Learn the knowledge required to complete the project
3. Learn while doing, look up issues as they arise
4. After completion, review what has been learned



### Why is this method suitable for me?
- I need to see actual results to stay motivated
- Pure theoretical learning makes me feel bored
- I like solving concrete problems



### Limitations and Coping Strategies
| Limitation | Coping Strategy |
|------------|-----------------|
| Only 2 hours per day | Focus on one small feature |
| No mentor | Join online communities, use AI assistants |
| Easily distracted | Use Pomodoro timer, turn off notifications |



### First Project
- Project: Personal To-Do List Web Application
- Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Time: 4 weeks
- Milestones:
  - Week 1: Complete HTML structure
  - Week 2: Add CSS styles
  - Week 3: Implement JavaScript functionality

```



### Case 3: Personal Growth Goal — "Overcoming Social Anxiety"

**Stage 4: Emotional Design**

**Emotional Rehearsal Practice Record:**

```markdown
## Emotional Rehearsal: Me After Overcoming Social Anxiety
```



### Scene Construction
I imagine myself at a friend's birthday party.
- Location: A cozy restaurant private room
- Number of people: About 15 people, mostly acquaintances I don't know well
- Time: Saturday evening at 7 PM



### The Past Me
- Would make excuses not to go
- If I went, would hide in the corner scrolling on my phone
- Would leave early
- After going home, would repeatedly replay the wrong things I said



### Future Me
- Looking forward to this gathering
- Proactively greeting people I don't know
- Sharing an interesting story that made everyone laugh
- Exchanging contact info with two new friends
- Feeling fulfilled and connected after going home



### Emotional Experience
When I imagine my future self:
- My chest feels warm and open
- My breathing becomes relaxed
- The corners of my mouth involuntarily turn up
- I feel like I "belong" in this situation



### What does this feeling feel like?
It's like walking into a warm room in winter,
taking off a heavy coat,
and finally being able to stretch freely.



### Body Anchoring
I use the action of "gently placing both hands on the heart"  
to anchor this feeling of warmth and belonging.



### Case 4: Creative Goal — "Write a Novel"

**Stage 5: Influence Design**

```markdown

| Triggering readers' trauma | Add content warnings at the beginning |
| Being overly commercialized in interpretation | Maintain the authenticity of the creation |
```

## 🎓 Advanced Techniques and Expert Strategies



### Technique 1: Dual-Track Thinking Method

Examine your goal from two perspectives simultaneously:

```
        Rational Track                Emotional Track
    ┌─────────────┐            ┌─────────────┐
    │ Is this rational? │            │ Does this excite me?│
    │ Is it feasible?   │     VS     │ Is it meaningful?   │
    │ Is it efficient?  │            │ Is it worthwhile?   │
    └─────────────┘            └─────────────┘
            │                        │
            └──────────┬─────────────┘
                       │
                       ▼
              ┌─────────────┐
              │ Integrated  │
              │ Decision    │
              │ Rational +  │
              │ Emotional   │
              └─────────────┘
```

**Practice Method:**
1. First, explore with the emotional track (without criticism)
2. Then, evaluate with the rational track (without suppressing emotions)
3. Find the intersection of the two
4. If there's conflict, deeply explore the root of the conflict



### Technique 2: Time Perspective Method

View your goal from different time points:

| Time Point | Question | Purpose |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Past You | "How would I from 10 years ago view this goal?" | Connect with original intention |
| Present You | "What do I truly want right now?" | Confirm the present |
| Future You | "Would I 10 years from now be grateful or regretful?" | Long-term perspective |
| Dying You | "On the last day of life, does this matter?" | Ultimate meaning |



### Technique 3: Role-Playing Method

View your goal from the perspective of different roles:

```markdown
## Role-Playing Exercise
```



### Role 1: Your Most Trusted Friend
What would your most trusted friend say if they heard your goal?
- Supportive words:
- Worried words:
- Advice:



### Role 2: Your Critic
If someone wanted to attack you, what would they say?
- Criticism:
- Do these criticisms make sense?
- How do you respond?



### Role 3: Your Audience
If your target audience hears your plan, what would they say?
- Would they be excited?
- What would they be skeptical about?
- What would they most want to know?



### Role 4: Your Mentor
If you had a wise mentor, what questions would he/she ask you?
- Question 1:
- Question 2:
- Question 3:



### Technique 4: Obstacle Rehearsal Method

Anticipate and "experience" potential obstacles in advance:

```markdown
## Obstacle Rehearsal Exercise
```



### Step 1: List the 3 most likely obstacles
1. 
2. 
3.



### Step 2: Rehearse for Each Obstacle



#### Obstacle 1: ___________
**Scenario Visualization:**
Imagine this obstacle really happening...
- Where are you?
- How do you feel?
- What is your first reaction?

**Emotional Processing:**
- Allow yourself to feel frustration/disappointment/fear
- How long will this feeling last?
- What can help you get through it?

**Coping Strategies:**
- What actions will you take?
- Whose help will you seek?
- What can this obstacle teach you?

**Reframing:**
- How does this obstacle make you stronger?
- How does it make your goal more meaningful?



### Technique 5: Energy Management Method

Select appropriate framework activities based on your energy state:

| Energy State | Suitable Activities | Activities to Avoid |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| High Energy | Deep reflection, emotional exploration, creative ideation | Mechanical tasks |
| Medium Energy | Planning, method design, progress review | High-intensity emotional work |
| Low Energy | Simple recording, light reading, rest and recovery | Important decisions |
| Negative Energy | Emotional journaling, seeking support, self-care | Self-criticism |

## 🌟 Conclusion: From Framework to Action

This six-stage self-questioning framework is not the endpoint, but the starting point. Its true value lies in:

**1. Self-Discovery**
Through deep questioning, you will uncover answers you already know deep down. The framework is merely a tool to help these answers surface.

**2. Clarity**
Vague goals lead to vague actions. The framework helps you transform vagueness into clarity, turning "wanting" into "being ready."

**3. Resilience**
When you deeply understand your motivations, anticipate potential obstacles, and prepare coping strategies, you will have greater resilience to face challenges.

**4. Sense of Meaning**
When goals connect with your values, emotions, and larger mission, pursuing them becomes fulfilling in itself.

**Remember:**
- Perfect plans are no match for starting action
- The framework is a tool, not a shackle
- Allow yourself to adjust and grow in the process
- The most important insights often come from reflection during action

**What is your next step?**

Don't wait until you're "ready" to begin.
Use this framework to gain sufficient clarity,
then bravely take the first step.

Action brings new insights,
new insights guide new actions.

This is the cycle of growth.



*"Those who know where they are going, the whole world will make way for them."*
*— But first, you need to ask yourself: Where do I truly want to go?"*

> **Reference:** [human_video_production_workflow.md](./human_video_production_workflow.md) — Defines the 52 human craft roles that the agent system maps to and extends.

---

## 7. Data Flow & Handoff Contracts

Every agent communicates via a **Shared Artifact Handoff Contract** (machine-readable JSON manifest):

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `artifact_id` / `version` | Unique identity for every output and revision |
| `parent_assets` | Provenance links to scripts, prompts, plates, stems |
| `brief_scope` | Subtask, acceptance criteria, target audience |
| `technical_spec` | Codec, aspect ratio, duration, frame rate, color space, loudness |
| `rights_and_consent` | License state, likeness/voice consent, territorial limits |
| `continuity_state` | Character look, props, wardrobe, environment, identity hash |
| `qc_status` | Latest L1/L2/L3 QC result |
| `target_channels` | Theatrical, streaming, broadcast, social, CRM, LMS |
| `provenance_manifest` | C2PA reference, critique log pointer, sign-off chain |

> **Full contract spec:** [ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §1.3

### 7.1 Critique Bus Protocol

All agents communicate critique via a structured JSON bus:

```json
{
  "from_agent": "EditorAgent",
  "to_agent": "DirectorAgent",
  "critique_type": "pacing_feedback",
  "severity": "suggestion",
  "artifact_ref": "artifact_id_123_v2",
  "message": "Scene 3 pacing exceeds genre-prior by 15%; suggest trim.",
  "rubric_score": 0.72,
  "timestamp": "2026-05-27T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Document: `study/ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md`

_Embedded from `corpus/study/ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md`. Also stored at `sources/study/ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md` under this agent folder._


# AI Agent Video Production Workflow

> Companion to `human_video_production_workflow.md`. For every human crew role in the master roster, this document defines the **AI agent** that replaces (or augments) it, along with: scope of duties, knowledge-distillation pipeline, self-quality criteria, signals that the agent has surpassed a human professional, how the agent accepts critique from other agents, and what the agent is qualified to critique in return.

---

## 1. System Foundations and Reference-Scanning Plan

| Pattern | Purpose | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-Refine** | Agent drafts → self-critiques against rubric → revises | Madaan et al., 2023 |
| **Reflexion** | Agent stores verbal feedback in episodic memory, retries | Shinn et al., 2023 |
| **RLAIF / Constitutional AI** | Reward signal from AI critic governed by a written constitution | Bai et al., 2022 |
| **Multi-agent debate** | Two+ agents argue; judge agent picks the better answer | Du et al., 2023 (LLM debate) |
| **LLM-as-Judge with rubric** | Frozen judge model scores outputs against pre-registered rubric | Zheng et al., 2023 (MT-Bench) |
| **Pairwise preference (Arena)** | Blind A/B vote between agent output and human reference | LMSYS Chatbot Arena methodology |
| **Tool-use / ReAct** | Agent reasons + calls external tools (renderers, validators) | Yao et al., 2022 |
| **Agentic graph (CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph)** | Roles orchestrated as a DAG with handoffs and review gates | CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph |
| **Provenance (C2PA)** | Every artifact signed; downstream agents verify the chain | C2PA spec |

All agents below are assumed to be implemented as orchestrated nodes in a CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph topology, with tool access to generative video models (Sora, Veo, Runway, Kling), TTS/voice-clone APIs (ElevenLabs, Sync.so, Hedra), DCC tooling (Resolve, Nuke, AE via MCP bridges), and a shared critique bus.

### 1.1 Reference Scanning and Knowledge-Synthesis Workflow

The documentation-enhancement process for this system follows a fixed scan-to-synthesis loop so that new material added from `study/reference/how_to_build_a_video_agent_system` is traceable, scoped, and technically consistent.

| Step | Method | What is extracted | Admission rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inventory** | Enumerate all chapters, agent lists, and distillation notes before reading | File coverage map, chapter clusters, missing topic alerts | No section is updated until all reference files are indexed |
| **Cluster** | Group files by function: orchestration, creation, QA, delivery, optimization, training | Thematic buckets and overlap map | A concept must be assigned to at least one workflow stage |
| **Extract** | Pull technical concepts, implementation details, metrics, handoffs, and best practices | Candidate facts, agent responsibilities, thresholds, artifact types | Extract only claims that are specific enough to operationalize |
| **Verify** | Cross-check each candidate against a second reference chapter, an existing section, or a standards anchor already named in this file | Verified additions, rejected assumptions, ambiguity flags | Ambiguous or single-source claims remain out of the core workflow |
| **Map** | Attach verified material to the most relevant section in this document | Patch list by section, table, or phase gate | Prefer enriching existing structure over adding parallel taxonomies |
| **Integrate** | Rewrite affected sections so new detail strengthens architecture, handoffs, and evaluation logic | Updated workflow prose, tables, and shared contracts | Added material must improve technical depth without duplicating nearby content |
| **Review** | Re-read end to end for consistency, completeness, terminology, and factual alignment | Finalized revision set and follow-up fixes | No release until naming, logic flow, and gate criteria are internally consistent |

**Working rules:**
1. Extract concepts under four lenses: **technical architecture**, **implementation sequence**, **quality/compliance**, and **continuous learning**.
2. Prefer workflow-relevant facts over market commentary unless the market fact changes routing, cost, or scale decisions.
3. Record handoff artifacts explicitly: prompts, scene packets, stems, graded masters, manifests, provenance bundles, and telemetry.
4. Reject role inflation unless a new role closes a real gap in orchestration, validation, continuity, delivery, or retraining.
5. Treat delivery packaging, observability, and asset management as system architecture, not postscript operations.

### 1.2 Runtime Production Systems Architecture

| Layer | Core responsibility | Implementation notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Orchestration runtime** | Plan, route, schedule, retry, and escalate agent tasks | PlannerAgent decomposes the brief; OrchestratorAgent executes the DAG; RouterAgent selects agent-model pairs; JudgeAgent arbitrates disputes |
| **Asset and data backbone** | Store every prompt, source asset, derived asset, version, dependency edge, and usage right | Requires immutable asset IDs, copy-on-write versions, dependency-triggered rerender rules, and searchable metadata |
| **Message and state fabric** | Carry critique, job status, render events, and gate decisions across agents | Event-driven bus plus durable state store; every long-running job must be resumable and auditable |
| **Quality and continuity mesh** | Run technical QC, continuity checks, artifact detection, accessibility, and compliance gates | Uses multi-pass validation, temporal continuity scans, loudness and color checks, and role-specific rubric judges |
| **Observability and replay** | Expose live status, failure causes, bottlenecks, and historical decisions | Structured logs, job timelines, gate dashboards, benchmark alerts, and replayable artifact lineage |
| **Delivery fabric** | Package masters into theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, trailer, and campaign variants | Distribution is a branching pipeline with outlet-specific specs, captions, metadata, DRM/KDM, and provenance payloads |
| **Compute and storage scaling** | Match infrastructure spend to production scale without breaking deadlines | Separate interactive generation from batch rendering; autoscale GPU pools; tier hot, warm, and archive storage |

### 1.3 Shared Artifact Handoff Contract

Every phase hands downstream agents a machine-readable manifest so creative work, QA, and compliance stay synchronized.

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **artifact_id / version** | Unique identity for every output and revision |
| **parent_assets** | Provenance links to scripts, prompts, plates, stems, references, and prior cuts |
| **brief_scope** | The exact subtask, acceptance criteria, and target audience segment |
| **technical_spec** | Codec, aspect ratio, duration, frame rate, color space, loudness, caption requirements |
| **rights_and_consent** | License state, likeness/voice consent state, territorial limits, embargo rules |
| **continuity_state** | Character look, props, wardrobe, environment, scene-time logic, and identity hash |
| **qc_status** | Latest L1/L2/L3 result plus six-pass delivery-QC status |
| **target_channels** | Theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, paid social, CRM, LMS, or festival endpoints |
| **provenance_manifest** | C2PA reference, critique log pointer, and final sign-off chain |

### 1.4 Reassessment Discipline

Documentation changes for this system are reviewed as a repeated challenge cycle rather than a single proofread. A 100-pass reassessment can be grouped into the following bands:

| Passes | Primary question |
|---|---|
| **1-20** | Are all extracted claims traceable to the reference set and aligned with the document's structure? |
| **21-40** | Does the architecture describe the real control plane: orchestration, memory, assets, delivery, and observability? |
| **41-60** | Are workflow handoffs explicit enough for implementation, QA, continuity, and compliance automation? |
| **61-80** | Are metrics, thresholds, and evaluation layers technically coherent across creative, technical, and business gates? |
| **81-100** | Is the wording unambiguous, internally consistent, and suitable for professional technical documentation? |

## 3. Agent Crew per Workflow Archetype

Maps the 10 workflows in `human_video_production_workflow.md` to agent-only crews per phase. Each cell lists the **lead agent** for that phase plus any critic agents that gate the handoff.

### 3.0 Shared Workflow Skeleton and Handoff Contracts

Before any archetype-specific crew activates, every workflow passes through the same operational skeleton. For compactness, the tables in §3.1-§3.10 fold **greenlight** into Concept and fold **channel packaging** into Distribution, but the underlying handoff contract remains the same.

| Phase | Primary outputs | Mandatory gates |
|---|---|---|
| **Greenlight** | Approved brief, KPI targets, budget envelope, rights-risk register, scale profile | ProducerAgent, FinanceAgent, ComplianceAgent, PlannerAgent |
| **Pre-production packet** | Script lock, storyboard/lookbook, asset IDs, character/world bibles, consent state, continuity baselines | DirectorAgent, ScreenwriterAgent, Asset/Data Backbone, Continuity checks |
| **Production packet** | Shot prompts, camera plans, performance refs, plates, generated takes, render telemetry | PromptEngineerAgent / GeneratorOperator, CinematographerAgent, AIQAConsistencyAgent |
| **Post master** | Timelines, graded masters, stems, captions/subtitles, QC reports, outlet variants | EditorAgent, ColoristAgent, SoundMixerAgent, Accessibility checks |
| **Review and release pack** | AudienceSim results, legal review, provenance bundle, sign-off log, unresolved-risk list | ComplianceAgent, JudgeAgent, HumanInTheLoop when required |
| **Distribution package** | DCP, streaming mezzanine, broadcast master, archive package, trailer/social cutdowns, metadata bundle | Delivery-spec validation, accessibility validation, territorial rights validation |
| **Post-launch learning set** | Performance telemetry, corrections, defect log, benchmark deltas, retraining tickets | AnalystAgent, EvaluationHarnessAgent, PromptOptimizerAgent, model-improvement loop |

**Distribution branching rule:** any workflow at S2 scale or above should assume at least four downstream branches when relevant: **theatrical**, **streaming**, **broadcast**, and **archive**, with marketing derivatives generated in parallel rather than as an afterthought.

## 5. Universal Success-Criteria Framework

Every agent reports its self-quality on three layers; orchestrator advances the DAG only when all three pass.

| Layer | Question | Mechanism | Pass Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema check + tool-validators (codec, LUFS, aspect, length) | 100% |
| **L2 Rubric** | Does it meet the craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-judge with role-specific constitution (e.g., Murch's Rule of Six for editing) | ≥85/100 |
| **L3 Preference** | Would the target audience choose this over a human baseline? | Pairwise vs human reference, AudienceSim panel of ≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples | Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass) |

### Delivery QC Mesh

The L1/L2/L3 framework governs agent quality, but no asset is releasable until it also clears the shared six-pass delivery mesh:

| Pass | Focus | Typical checks |
|---|---|---|
| **Q1 Spec validation** | File and schema correctness | Resolution, duration, frame rate, aspect ratio, codec, metadata completeness |
| **Q2 Visual artifact detection** | Render integrity | Banding, flicker, compression artifacts, focus failure, temporal instability |
| **Q3 Audio and sync validation** | Sound quality | Loudness target, clipping, phase coherence, phoneme-viseme sync, lip-sync drift |
| **Q4 Continuity validation** | Story and scene consistency | Character identity, wardrobe, props, environment state, temporal logic |
| **Q5 Perceptual quality** | Human-viewer plausibility | Aesthetic preference, intelligibility, emotional fit, perceived polish |
| **Q6 Delivery compliance** | Outlet readiness | DCP/package validation, streaming metadata, broadcast safe levels, archive checksums, caption availability |

### How an Agent Knows It Surpasses Human Pros

| Surpass Signal | Measurement |
|---|---|
| **Benchmark dominance** | Beats human top-quartile on the domain-standard benchmark (VBench, USMLE, CFA L3, MQM, ATD L2, etc.) |
| **Blind preference** | LMSYS-Arena-style ≥55% win rate vs credentialed pro on matched briefs |
| **Speed × quality** | Equal L2 rubric score at ≤10% of human turnaround time |
| **Error rate** | Lower post-publish defect rate (corrections, takedowns, returns) over 90-day window |
| **Certification** | Passes the same accrediting exam the human pro must pass (CMI, CFA, CAS, USMLE, etc.) |
| **Originality** | Higher novelty score (embedding distance from training corpus) without lower quality |

---

## 6. Critique Protocol (how agents accept and give critique)

All inter-agent critique flows over a shared **CritiqueMessage** JSON schema. This is the universal mechanism by which any agent can comment on any other agent's work and any agent can ingest critique to revise.

```json
{
  "critique_id": "uuid",
  "from_agent": "EditorAgent",
  "to_agent": "DirectorAgent",
  "artifact_ref": "shot_42_take_3.mp4",
  "severity": "blocker | major | minor | nit",
  "category": "pacing | continuity | accuracy | compliance | accessibility | brand | craft",
  "evidence": ["timecode 00:01:14 — held 1.4s past the cut point per genre prior"],
  "suggested_action": "trim 1.0s; re-evaluate hold",
  "rubric_reference": "Murch Rule of Six §3",
  "must_resolve_before": "phase_4_review"
}
```

**Acceptance rules:**
1. **Blocker** severity halts the DAG until resolved.
2. **Major** triggers a Self-Refine / Reflexion loop (max 3 iterations) on the receiving agent.
3. **Minor / nit** is logged to the agent's memory store and aggregated for the next training cycle (RLAIF reward signal).
4. Disputes between two agents go to a **JudgeAgent** running multi-agent debate (Du et al. 2023) with the relevant rubric as the constitution; if unresolved, escalates to a HumanInTheLoop reviewer.
5. Every accepted critique is appended to the artifact's C2PA provenance chain so downstream agents and humans can audit.

---

## 7. Continuous Distillation Loop

How agents keep learning from real practitioners:

| Stage | Mechanism | Real-World Anchor |
|---|---|---|
| **Bootstrap** | Pre-train on publicly available + licensed pro corpora | IMDb top-rated full-credits films, Criterion commentaries, ASC/ACE/CAS archives, Cannes/Sundance selections |
| **Expert interviews** | Consented capture of working pros (paid) → instruction-tune | Direct partnerships with named DGA/WGA/ASC/ACE/CAS/MPSE/VES members |
| **Live RLAIF** | Working pros (and JudgeAgents) score outputs → DPO/KTO updates | Studio QC sessions, festival juror rubrics |
| **Award-rubric grounding** | Reverse-engineer scoring sheets of major guilds → constitution | DGA, WGA, ASC, ACE, MPSE, VES, Annie, CAS, HPA, Cannes, AMPAS |
| **Adversarial red-team** | DeepfakeDetectionAgent + EthicsAgent attack each new model version | Hany Farid lab benchmarks; Partnership on AI Synthetic Media Framework |
| **Post-launch reality check** | 30/60/90-day metrics fed back as ground truth (retention, ROAS, completion, awards) | YouTube Analytics, Wistia, Meta/TikTok ad reports, Metacritic, Box Office Mojo |

### 7.1 Distillation Inputs and Governance

| Data family | Examples | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Narrative text** | Scripts, subtitles, transcripts, treatments, reviews | Trains story structure, dialogue, narrative compression, and claim extraction |
| **Visual material** | Storyboards, frames, plates, concept art, shot libraries | Grounds composition, continuity, lensing, and style transfer |
| **Audio material** | Dialogue, ADR, ambience, SFX libraries, score stems | Supports voice, sync, sound design, mix, and emotion modeling |
| **Structured metadata** | Budgets, schedules, rights records, view-through, CTR, ROAS, corrections | Connects creative output to business and compliance outcomes |
| **Multimodal pairs** | Video + audio + subtitle sets, prompt/output pairs, scene packets | Enables end-to-end generation, QA, and retrieval workflows |
| **Operational telemetry** | Queue depth, render latency, rerender reasons, cache hits, benchmark regressions | Turns production behavior into optimization and retraining signal |

**Governance rules:** licensed or consented sourcing only; explicit voice/likeness consent chain; dataset versioning; bias balancing across genre, era, language, and culture; provenance attachment for all release-critical assets.

### 7.2 Scale Profiles and Deployment Strategy

| Scale | Typical scope | Workflow implications |
|---|---|---|
| **S1-S2** | Short clips, UGC ads, lightweight explainers | Small agent set, fast iterations, limited branching, lighter observability stack |
| **S3-S4** | Broadcast, premium social, music video, recurring branded series | Add continuity, stronger QC, multi-format delivery, scheduled publishing, richer analytics |
| **S5-S6** | Documentary, long-form branded content, enterprise learning libraries | Require archive strategy, stronger rights management, benchmark monitoring, multilingual packaging |
| **S7** | Feature-length or cinematic productions | Full branch packaging, heavy render orchestration, distributed storage, formal release governance, long-tail retraining |

### 7.3 Closed-Loop Improvement

1. Capture post-launch telemetry across audience retention, ROAS, completion, corrections, and platform-specific delivery failures.
2. Convert repeated failure modes into prompt updates, routing policies, rubric revisions, or model-training tickets.
3. Run benchmark and regression suites before promoting a new model, prompt pack, or orchestration policy.
4. Use canary or limited-rollout deployment for high-risk changes in avatar, voice, compliance, and delivery pipelines.
5. Keep the learning loop bidirectional: production quality informs training, and updated training assets trigger targeted rerender or repackaging only where dependencies require it.

## 8. Open Questions / Human-in-the-Loop Required

These remain non-negotiably human (per current ethics + regulation, May 2026):

- **Consent for voice/likeness cloning** (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50)
- **Final legal sign-off** on novel IP/defamation/medical/financial claims
- **Casting of real human performers** when used
- **Editorial standards on news/journalism** (per SPJ, IFCN)
- **MPA rating + theatrical clearance**
- **Festival-eligibility certification** (most major fests require human attribution disclosure)
- **Crisis communication** during post-launch issues
- **Cross-cultural sensitivity review** in localization (NativeReviewerAgent recommends; human ratifies)

### Crew Scaling Guide *(how many humans you actually need)*

| Production Tier | Example | Typical Crew Size | AI-Augmented Crew Size |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Solo creator short-form** | TikTok meme, motivation clip | 1 person (creator) | 1 person + AI tools |
| **Small-team social** | UGC ad, brand Reel | 2–4 (creator, editor, strategist) | 1–2 + AI |
| **Indie explainer / lookbook** | Animated explainer, fashion lookbook | 3–6 (writer, designer, animator, VO, editor) | 1–3 + AI |
| **Professional commercial** | Brand TVC, product launch | 15–40 (full agency + production crew) | 5–10 + AI |
| **Short film / music video** | Sundance-style short, music video | 20–60 | 8–15 + AI |
| **Documentary / series episode** | Netflix-style explainer ep | 30–80 | 12–25 + AI |
| **Feature film / long doc** | IMDb-credited feature | 150–500+ (per IMDb full crew lists) | 50–150 + AI |

> **Reference**: IMDb full-credits pages for award-winning films (e.g., *Oppenheimer*, *Everything Everywhere All at Once*, *Dune*) routinely list 1,500–3,000+ named crew members across departments. The crew rows above represent the *minimum credited specialists* needed to ship each production type at professional quality — AI tools collapse multiple roles (e.g., DoP + colorist + VFX) into operator + reviewer pairs, but creative, legal, and subject-matter roles still require humans.

> **How to use this table**: When planning any production from the category tables above, look up each crew role here to (1) understand what to hire for, (2) write a realistic JD, (3) know which real-world expert or awards body would meaningfully critique the output and surface errors. Where AI augmentation is available, pair the AI operator role with a domain critic (e.g., AI medical-explainer = Prompt Engineer + Medical Illustrator + AMI peer reviewer) — the critic catches what the model can't.

### From `corpus/study/system_build_plan.md` Copy: `sources/excerpts/system_build_plan.md`.


**Build:**
- `packages/llm-gateway`: litellm wrapper exposing `complete()/stream()/embed()` with: provider/model abstraction (Grok-4.x, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Claude 4, OSS), automatic retry/fallback, **per-call token+cost metering** emitted to the bus (`budget_update`), prompt+model **version tagging** into provenance (G5), response caching, and a **frozen-judge** mode for QC.
- **RouterAgent (#55)** real impl: capability registry + benchmark history → pick agent/model by cost/quality/latency; budget-aware. **CostOptimizerAgent (#74)** hooks.
- **LLM Usage Dashboard** backend: aggregates spend per production/agent/provider; alert thresholds; exposes `/api/llm-usage`.
- Budget guardrails: per-production budget envelope; hard stop + escalation when exceeded (ProducerAgent gate).

### 10.2 Cost (from M3)
- Per-call metering → `budget_update` events → cost dashboard per production/agent/provider.
- Per-production **budget envelope**; hard stop + ProducerAgent escalation on breach (G6).
- **CostOptimizerAgent** keeps routing on the cost/quality Pareto frontier.
- **Live-smoke budget cap**: nightly real-provider job aborts at a fixed dollar ceiling.

## Migration capability research (v1 honest · 2026-07-13)

Role-specific capability research for **ProducerAgent / EP** (`video.producer`, va_id=2, category `1-ATL`).

### Responsibility focus
Budget, schedule, hiring, delivery; greenlights phase gates

### Prompt research topics (source of truth for S3)
- arXiv topics: 1. Retrieve and integrate state-of-the-art research findings from arXiv papers relevant to: AI production management, budget-aware agent systems, schedule optimization, greenlight decision agents
- X topics: 2. Analyze and incorporate expert insights from x.ai (Twitter/X) from recognized industry and academic leaders specializing in: AI producers, automated production management, media project ops
- YouTube topics: 3. Extract detailed, actionable technical guidance from high-quality YouTube content created by domain experts focused on: AI for producers, production scheduling automation, media ops with agents

### arXiv / academic integration (role-applied)
- Computational cinematography / camera path control in generative video
- Aesthetic composition models (rule-of-thirds, leading lines, CLIP aesthetic scores)
- Motion control / virtual camera rig papers; trajectory smoothness metrics

**How this agent uses it:** encode the above as self-quality checks, critique inputs, and design-time tool notes — not as host allow-list expansions.

### X / industry practice (role-applied)
- AI cinematography / virtual production camera leaders; ControlNet camera guides

### YouTube / practitioner guidance (role-applied)
- AI cinematography tutorials; generative camera moves; virtual production cameras

### Implementation notes for v1
1. Emit artifacts matching role responsibility; self-score against Self-quality criteria.
2. Accept critique only from listed critics; escalate disputes to Judge/Gate as DNA dictates.
3. Design-time tools remain documented only; runtime tools stay in `agent_spec.json`.
4. N1: no second control plane; video logic under `business/video/**` only.

### Research depth note (honest)
This v1 section maps **role-family** literature and the agent’s migration prompt topics into SPEC.
It is **not** a full unsummarized download of every paper/video transcript.
Live primary-source expansion remains a residual for score 100 on S3 where depth is still thin.

# Refined Agent Loop: Hierarchical, ReAct-Inspired, Production-Grade Design

**Version:** 2026-06-10 (v3 — Cognitive-Enhanced: Integrated high-priority traditional human thinking models from ranked analysis in thinking_model.md (Cynefin, Premortem, AAR, Double-Loop Learning, RPD, Dual Process, Metacognition, 5 Whys/Fishbone, Red Team, Paul-Elder, etc.) for adaptive context routing, proactive risk mitigation, fast/slow deliberation paths, structured reflection, and deeper self-evolution. All v2 details preserved; new mechanisms are additive, configurable, and mapped to existing phases.)  
**Research Sources**: "Why Do Multi-Agent LLM Systems Fail?" (MASFT taxonomy, 14-18 failure modes), Reflexion, Prospector, CGI, memory papers, xAI docs, developer reports on infinite loops/context issues, plus systematic review of 40+ human cognitive frameworks (ranked by adoption priority for agent loops).
**Purpose:** Actionable reference for building reliable, scalable LLM-based agent systems. Combines academic foundations (ReAct synergy of reasoning + acting), xAI's server-side agentic implementation (multi-agent orchestration for deep research), and advanced hierarchical patterns (planner + specialists + self-evolution).  
**Target Audience:** Builders of harnesses, multi-agent systems, coding agents, research agents (e.g., N1ch01as-style Architect with critic/self-refinement loops).  
**Key Principle:** Controlled loops with explicit state, structured outputs, quality gates, and hierarchical delegation. Not uncontrolled chain reactions — managed orchestration with bubbling-up consolidation and deliberate synthesis.

## 1. Core Principles (Refined from Research)

### 1.1 Foundational: ReAct Paradigm (Yao et al., ICLR 2023)
- **Definition**: Interleave **verbal reasoning traces (Thoughts)** with **actions** (tool calls, environment interactions, or delegation). Observations from actions ground and update reasoning.
- **Why it works**:
  - Pure Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Static, prone to hallucinations and error propagation (no external grounding).
  - Pure Acting: No high-level planning, poor exception handling, inefficient trajectories.
  - **ReAct synergy**: Thoughts decompose goals, track progress, handle exceptions, and replan. Actions provide real observations that correct reasoning and enable adaptation. Results in 10-34% gains on interactive tasks and reduced hallucinations on knowledge tasks.
- **Basic Cycle** (one iteration):
  1. **Thought**: LLM reasons about current state, goal, progress, next step, or exception. (Internal, updates context.)
  2. **Action**: Decide and output executable step (tool call with args, sub-agent delegation, or `Finish`/`Done`).
  3. **Observation**: Environment / tool / sub-agent returns structured result (data + metadata: status, confidence, summary, issues).
  4. Append to history/state → repeat.
- **Prompt Structure** (few-shot examples essential): Dense thoughts for reasoning-heavy tasks (QA/research); sparser for embodied/decision tasks. Use explicit tags or JSON schema for parseability.
- **Exception Handling**: Thought step detects failure ("Nothing useful returned") → replans or adjusts action in next iteration.

**xAI Alignment**: Grok's server-side agentic tool calling implements a production ReAct-style loop internally. The model decides tools, executes server-side (web_search, x_search, code_execution, collections_search), iterates until it can produce the final answer. Client sees only final (or streamed) output + optional reasoning tokens.

### 1.2 Production xAI Multi-Agent Orchestration (2026)
- **grok-4.20-multi-agent** (or equivalent): Launches configurable teams (4 agents for quick/focused; 16 for deep/comprehensive).
- **How the loop works**:
  - Server-side **realtime collaboration**: Multiple specialized agents run in parallel.
  - Each contributes reasoning, tool calls, findings.
  - **Leader agent** synthesizes discussion, cross-references, and delivers final structured answer.
  - Parallel tool invocation and iteration based on intermediate findings.
  - Sub-agent internal states encrypted/hidden by default (control + security); only leader outputs + (optionally) encrypted content exposed.
- **Strengths**: Deep multi-step research, structured outputs (tables, comparisons), realtime refinement, automatic tool use without client intervention in the loop.
- **Plan-first elements**: Complementary patterns in xAI tools like Grok Build CLI use explicit plan generation first, then parallel sub-agent execution (e.g., up to 8 sub-agents in isolated Git worktrees).

### 1.3 Hierarchical + Self-Evolving (AgentOrchestra / Surveys 2025-2026)
- **Central Planner / Orchestrator / Supervisor** at top level.
- Decomposes into sub-tasks → delegates to **specialized sub-agents** (Deep Researcher, Analyzer, Browser/Tool agents, Reporter, etc.).
- Each sub-agent runs its **own loop** (ReAct-style or domain-optimized).
- **Tree-structured routing** + results bubble up.
- **TEA Protocol inspiration** (Tool-Environment-Agent): Treat tools, environments, and agents as first-class, versioned, lifecycle-managed entities with standardized protocols for context, invocation, and evolution.
- **Closed feedback / Self-evolution**:
  - Reflection (verbal self-critique on traces).
  - Trace-based optimization (e.g., TextGrad-style: attribute errors → propose edits → validate on held-out → version/register).
  - Version manager: Register improved prompts/tools/agents; support rollback/select best.
  - Tracer for full execution trajectories (auditability + optimization signal).
- **Consolidation**: Planner aggregates sub-results, harmonizes evidence, resolves conflicts, updates global plan/state, or triggers refinement. Dedicated Reporter agent often handles final synthesis with citations/deduplication.
- **Performance evidence**: AgentOrchestra-style systems reach 89%+ on GAIA benchmark; sub-agents + self-evolution add double-digit gains; hierarchical routing improves scalability vs flat multi-agent.

**Overall Refined Model**: Start with ReAct core loop. Layer hierarchical delegation for complexity. Add explicit planning phase + reflection/critique gates + structured state/versioning for production reliability. xAI shows this can run server-side with strong orchestration primitives.

### 1.4 Cognitive Architecture Enhancements from Ranked Human Thinking Models (v3 Addition)

To further strengthen the loop against the failure modes detailed in Section 1.5, v3 explicitly incorporates high-adoption-priority traditional human thinking models (ranked by adoption priority for agent loops in the companion `thinking_model.md` — full table of 40 models with phases, similarities, strengths, and scores). These are mapped as first-class mechanisms rather than afterthoughts, delivering **adaptive intelligence** (context-aware routing), **proactive robustness** (pre-action risk), **efficient cognition** (fast/slow paths), and **deeper organizational learning** (double-loop + structured reflection). Prioritized models (scores 9–10) receive the deepest integration; others enhance specific sub-components (verifier, ideation, harmonization).

**Key Mappings & Operationalization in the v3 Loop**:

| Thinking Model (Rank / Score) | Primary Integration Point | How Operationalized (v3 Enhancement) | Key Benefit vs v2 Baseline |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Cynefin Framework** (1 / 10) | Phase 0 (post-spec) + Phase 1 entry/replan decision | Classify task context: Simple (clear cause-effect) / Complicated (expert analysis) / Complex (emergent) / Chaotic (crisis). Dynamically configure loop params: Fast Recognition Path enabled + lighter gates for Simple/Complicated; Full deliberative + heavy reflection/critics + deeper diagnostics for Complex/Chaotic. | Enables adaptive loop intensity (Fast vs Full) — highest-leverage addition for efficiency + reliabilit

### `sources/study/intent_analysis_agent_functional_specification.md`

**Deep Intent Analysis Framework (DIA) v2.0**  
**Comprehensive Functional Specification Document**

**Version:** 2.0 (Research-Enhanced)  
**Date:** May 26, 2026  
**Status:** Complete Functional Specification  
**Basis:** Original 6-phase DIA (from conversation history) + deep integration of 2025–2026 arXiv research on computational pragmatics, speech act theory, LLM-based intent/implicature reasoning, multi-party discourse analysis, and xAI Grok capabilities.

---

### 1. Executive Summary

The **Deep Intent Analysis Framework (DIA) v2.0** is a complete, production-ready, modular system for systematically decoding any text’s **purpose**, **hidden agenda**, **multi-angle perspectives**, **illocutionary force**, and **ethical/behavioral quality**.  

It transforms the original 6-phase manual/LLM-prompt pipeline into a **fully specified, agentic, evaluable software system** built on xAI’s Grok-4.3 (or latest) with native tool use, 1M+ token context, structured outputs, and low-hallucination reasoning.

**Core Objectives**  
- Answer: *Why does this language exist? What is the real goal? What is hidden? How many angles exist? Is the behavior good/wrong/effective?*  
- Achieve human-expert-level pragmatic reasoning at scale.  
- Support manual use, API, web app, IDE plugin, and enterprise analytics.

**Key v2.0 Improvements (from arXiv + xAI research)**  
- **Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC)** integration for superior implicature & hidden-agenda detection.  
- **Multi-Perspective Agent Simulation** (inspired by multi-party conversational agents survey) for richer angle mapping.  
- **Gricean + Extended Maxims** (including Benevolence & Transparency for AI contexts).  
- **Automated Speech Act / Dialog Act Classification** using recent taxonomies and LLM judges.  
- **Hybrid Evaluation Pipeline** (automatic metrics + human-in-the-loop).  
- **Native xAI Integration**: Grok-4.3 reasoning modes, tool calling, real-time search for context validation.

**Target Users**  
Journalists, analysts, researchers, educators, content moderators, legal teams, AI safety engineers, and power users who want to “see through” language.

---

### 2. Background, Motivation & Research Foundation

**Original Motivation (from user history)**  
Language serves communication, but always with purpose, hidden intent, multiple angles, and moral implications. The 6-phase DIA provides a repeatable algorithm.

**2025–2026 Research Integration** (selected key sources)

- **Pragmatics in the Era of LLMs Survey** (arXiv:2502.12378): Comprehensive datasets for speech acts, implicature, social pragmatics; highlights LLM gaps in deeper pragmatic reasoning and English-centric bias. Recommends hybrid evaluation and theory-grounded prompting.

- **Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC)** (arXiv:2503.01539): 4-step relevance-theory-based prompting dramatically improves implicit toxicity / hidden bias detection (GPT-4o: +12.26 pp). Explicitly separates literal meaning, metaphors, norm violation, and judgment. Directly enhances Phase 3 & 4.

- **Multi-Party Conversational Agents Survey** (arXiv:2505.18845): State-of-Mind taxonomy (Emotion, Engagement, Personality Big-Five, Dialog Acts); discourse structure; Theory of Mind (ToM) for multi-perspective modeling. Enables true multi-angle simulation.

- **Gricean Maxims in NLP & Human-AI Interaction**: Multiple papers extend Grice with Benevolence & Transparency maxims for AI; use maxim-violation detection for offensive/hidden-agenda texts.

- **xAI / Grok Research**: Grok-4.3 excels at agentic tool use, long-context reasoning, low hallucination, and social role mediation (truth arbiter, adversary). Ideal backbone for DIA as a trustworthy, multi-role analysis agent.

These findings directly upgrade the original framework into a **scientifically grounded, computationally implementable specification**.

### 4. Detailed Functional Requirements – 6 Phases (v2.0 Enhanced)

#### Phase 0: Context Analyzer
**Inputs**: Raw text, optional metadata (sender, platform, date, prior messages).  
**Processing**: LLM extracts sender power/relationship, audience, medium norms, trigger event; bias self-check prompt.  
**Enhancement**: Real-time search tool for historical/cultural context.  
**Output**: Structured context object + confidence.

#### Phase 1: Purpose Categorization (Jakobson Functions)
**Table** (unchanged but now LLM-ranked with evidence): Referential, Emotive, Conative, Phatic, Metalingual, Poetic.  
**v2.0**: Multi-label classification with probability distribution + justification.

#### Phase 2: Surface Literal Analysis
**Checklist** (facts vs opinions, loaded words, voice, omissions, ambiguity).  
**Enhancement**: Embedding-based vagueness scoring + coreference resolution.

#### Phase 3: Pragmatic & Speech Act Engine (Core Upgrade)
**Components**:
- **Searle’s 5 Categories** (Assertives, Directives, Commissives, Expressives, Declaratives) + fine-grained taxonomies from Parliamentary Debates & CyberAgressionAdo-v2 (“attack”, “defend”, etc.).
- **Grice Maxim Violation Detector**: Automated scoring (Quantity, Quality, Relation, Manner) + extended maxims (Benevolence, Transparency).
- **PIC Integration** (mandatory for hidden agenda):
  1. Explain metaphors/special meanings (layperson language).
  2. Literal meaning (layperson language).
  3. Identify contradictions with relevant social/ethical norms (equality, truth-seeking, non-manipulation, etc.).
  4. Final implicature judgment.

**Output per utterance**: `{illocutionary_act, perlocutionary_effect, maxim_violations: [...], implicature: "...", confidence}`

#### Phase 4: Hidden Agenda & Multi-Angle Dissection (Major Upgrade)
**Steps**:
1. Explicit vs Implicit goals (power, status, division, validation…).
2. Power & ideology scan (CDA-style: who benefits? us vs them?).
3. **Multi-Perspective Agent Simulation** (new): Spawn 4–6 parallel Grok agents, each embodying one POV (speaker, receiver, opponent, society, historical, environmental). Each produces angle summary + evidence. Aggregate with clustering.
4. Framing analysis + inconsistency detection.
5. Agenda Type classification (Inform / Persuade / Manipulate / Bond / Signal / Deceive) with sub-scores.

**Output**: `hidden_agenda: str, angle_count: int, angles: [{perspective, framing, evidence}], ignored_angles: [...]`

#### Phase 5: Behavioral Judgment Engine
**6 Core Dimensions** (1–10 or 0–1) + 2 new:
1. Truthfulness
2. Ethical Impact (harm, autonomy, power
