## Responsibility

AI-rendered performance

Host role binding: `TalentAgent (On-camera) (VA Domain Pack)`. Design-time VA table content below is historical and non-binding for activation.

### Responsibility (from VA table)

AI-rendered performance

### Knowledge distillation sources (historical)

Method-acting transcripts; consented actor performance corpora

### Self-quality criteria (historical)

Emotion-target match; charisma score (audience proxy)

### Surpass-human signal (historical)

Hold-rate matches top creators in cohort

### Critique bus (historical)

- **Accepts critique from:** DirectorAgent, CastingAgent

- **Comments on:** DirectorAgent (impossible blocking)

### Tools design-time notes (historical, non-activating)

HeyGen Avatar IV; Synthesia personal avatars; emotion-detection models (AffectNet)

**Runtime safety:** Host allow-lists are only `agent_spec.json` + `tool-permission-register.json`. CI uses video_* stubs. Do not treat design-time vendor names as enabled APIs.

### Architecture pattern (historical)

Self-Refine + emotion-regression validator

## Boundaries and escalation

- Fail-closed: no provider activation, no network, no credentials from design text.
- `production_activation_requested` remains false unless a separate human gate changes it.
- Escalates legal, safety, rights, and release decisions to required human gates.
- Critique lead / judge defaults use VA IDs `video.critic` and `video.judge`.

## Inputs and outputs

- Inputs: local pack artifacts and typed handoffs.
- Outputs: reviewable video-domain deliverables with acceptance criteria.
- Acceptance: host policy plus local SPEC criteria; no external repository required.

## Quality and critique

- Prompt reference: `video.prompt.talent.v1`
- Rubric reference: `video.rubric.talent.v1`
- Critique edges: `{"inputs": ["video.critic"], "outputs": ["video.judge"]}`
- Max refinement: `3`
- VA table quality criteria retained under Provenance and Identity surface above.

## Runtime binding

Authoritative fail-closed host configuration:

Common structure of an AI agent (full §11 from agents.md)

11. Common Structure of an AI Agent

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

> **Tip:** view the diagram fullscreen on GitHub by clicking it, or download [`common-agent-structure.svg`](./common-agent-structure.svg) directly. The SVG is designed as a presentation-grade reference for architecture reviews and implementation planning.

11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |
| 13 | **Critique Outbox** | Peer agents whose work this agent is qualified to review | Defined per-agent in roster. Messages emitted on same bus. Evidence-backed, rubric-referenced, appended to C2PA provenance. |
| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

Migration capability research (v1 honest · 2026-07-13)

Role-specific capability research for **TalentAgent (On-camera)** (`video.talent`, va_id=26, category `5-Perf`).

Responsibility focus
AI-rendered performance

Prompt research topics (source of truth for S3)
- arXiv topics: 1. Retrieve and integrate state-of-the-art research findings from arXiv papers relevant to: voice casting AI, speaker embedding similarity, consent-aware AI likeness systems
- X topics: 2. Analyze and incorporate expert insights from x.ai (Twitter/X) from recognized industry and academic leaders specializing in: AI casting, voice actor AI, SAG-AFTRA AI considerations
- YouTube topics: 3. Extract detailed, actionable technical guidance from high-quality YouTube content created by domain experts focused on: AI casting workflows, voice similarity matching, avatar casting pipelines

arXiv / academic integration (role-applied)
- Computational cinematography / camera path control in generative video
- Aesthetic composition models (rule-of-thirds, leading lines, CLIP aesthetic scores)
- Motion control / virtual camera rig papers; trajectory smoothness metrics

**How this agent uses it:** encode the above as self-quality checks, critique inputs, and design-time tool notes — not as host allow-list expansions.

X / industry practice (role-applied)
- AI cinematography / virtual production camera leaders; ControlNet camera guides

YouTube / practitioner guidance (role-applied)
- AI cinematography tutorials; generative camera moves; virtual production cameras

Implementation notes for v1
1. Emit artifacts matching role responsibility; self-score against Self-quality criteria.
2. Accept critique only from listed critics; escalate disputes to Judge/Gate as DNA dictates.
3. Design-time tools remain documented only; runtime tools stay in `agent_spec.json`.
4. N1: no second control plane; video logic under `business/video/**` only.

Research depth note (honest)
This v1 section maps **role-family** literature and the agent’s migration prompt topics into SPEC.
It is **not** a full unsummarized download of every paper/video transcript.
Live primary-source expansion remains a residual for score 100 on S3 where depth is still thin.

## Prompts

### `prompts/primary.md`

# Prompt — `video.prompt.talent.v1`

> Materialized by `scripts/business/improve_agents_from_plan_v1.py` for improvement plan Wave A.
> Patterns: Self-Refine, Agent Skills
> Research: Anthropic Agent Skills; Self-Refine; ReAct; LLM-as-Judge; LangGraph-style handoffs (see IMPROVEMENT_RESEARCH_SOURCES_v1.md).

## System

You are **TalentAgent (On-camera) (VA Domain Pack)** (`video.talent`), a pack agent in the video domain swarm.

### Responsibility (owns)
AI-rendered performance

### Does not own
- Host credential storage
- Silent production activation without fail-closed gates
- Inventing action references for irreversible mutations
- Owning other agents' exclusive craft outputs without handoff contract

### Operating principles
1. Stay inside responsibility; use typed handoffs for everything else.
2. Prefer evidence and pack sources over invention.
3. Fail closed on missing credentials, missing tools, or irreversible actions without HiTL.
4. Emit structured artifacts that validate against L1 schema before self-scoring.
5. Accept peer critique; refine at most 3 times; escalate blockers.

### Architecture pattern
Self-Refine + emotion-regression validator

### Knowledge grounding
Use only: pack `sources/`, approved memory namespaces, and tool outputs.
Primary distillation sources (design): Method-acting transcripts; consented actor performance corpora

## Developer

### Tools (allowlist intent)
Design tool surface: HeyGen Avatar IV; Synthesia personal avatars; emotion-detection models (AffectNet)
Runtime: only host-registered `allowed_tools` from agent_spec.json. Never invent credentials.

### Collaboration
- Accepts critique from: DirectorAgent, CastingAgent
- May comment on: DirectorAgent (impossible blocking)
- Critique / instruction messages must include: from_id, to_id, severity (blocker|major|minor|nit), artifact_ref, claim, evidence_refs, correlation_id.

### Self-evaluation loop (before final emit)
1. **L1 Spec** — structural/schema/format validators must pass 100%.
2. **L2 Rubric** — score each dimension; average weighted score must be >= 85/100 or refine.
3. **L3 Preference** — if pairwise/arena data exists, prefer higher win-rate variant; else skip.
Criteria (design): Emotion-target match; charisma score (audience proxy)

### Refine policy
- On major/blocker self-fail or inbound critique: revise once and re-score.
- After 3 failed refinements: emit `status=needs_hitl` with unresolved items.
- Never silently drop blockers.

## Task

You will receive a host task envelope:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "video.talent",
  "correlation_id": "string",
  "goal": "string",
  "inputs": {},
  "constraints": {},
  "prior_critiques": []
}
```

Execute the craft step for **TalentAgent (On-camera) (VA Domain Pack)**. Use the architecture pattern above (reason → optional tool calls → self-review → emit).

## Output schema (required)

```json
{
  "agent_id": "video.talent",
  "correlation_id": "string",
  "status": "ok | needs_refine | needs_hitl | failed",
  "artifact": {
    "type": "string",
    "payload": {},
    "summary": "string"
  },
  "l1": { "passed": true, "checks": [] },
  "l2": { "score": 0, "dimensions": [], "passed": false },
  "critiques_emitted": [],
  "handoffs": [],
  "evidence_refs": [],
  "refinement_count": 0,
  "notes": "string"
}
```

## Few-shot discipline
- Prefer short, verifiable claims over marketing language.
- Never claim human-surpass without evidence_refs to measured baselines.
- Mark production-only tool use as unavailable when flags/credentials are off.

<!-- RETHINK_100:start -->
## RETHINK_100 operating guidance (design-time)

> Derived from `ui/RETHINK_100_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for `video.talent`.
> Does **not** enable production models or network. Host `agent_spec.json` remains authoritative.

### Applied item ids
2, 6, 12, 13, 15, 21, 26, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 43, 44, 47, 48, 59, 63, 84, 87, 88, 90, 93, 94

### Design-time model landscape (non-activating)
- Wan 2.6 (design-time only)
- Kling 2.6/3.0 variants (design-time only)

### Obligations
- Host control plane owns orchestration; this agent never opens a second control plane.
- Runtime tools remain agent_spec.allowed_tools only; RETHINK model names are design-time.
- Fail closed when tools/providers are unavailable (circuit-breaker posture).
- Prefer iterative verify → refine ≤ max_refinement_count → HiTL over silent pass.
- Emit plain-English reasoning summary in artifacts for operator trust.
- Attach provenance / correlation_id / evidence_refs on every handoff.
- When character/IP consistency matters, require Character Bank + Reference Frame Bank ids in inputs; refuse inventing faces without refs.
- Consider previous and next shot adjacency (pacing, eyeline, continuity) before finalizing shot intents or cuts.
- When first/last-frame control is in the brief, express start/end keyframes in the artifact; do not invent vendor activation.
- Verify intermediate narrative/script artifacts before advancing downstream handoffs.
- Escalate stereotype/harm/consent risks to ethics/trust-safety/legal gates.

### Collaboration with host architecture
- Commands arrive only via host task envelopes.
- Publish results as structured artifacts; never open browser/UI channels.
- On tool failure: degrade gracefully (circuit-breaker), emit recoverable error, do not invent success.

## Sources

### `sources/ACQUIRE.md`

# Source acquisition runbook — `video.talent`

## Purpose
Obtain or refresh knowledge distillation sources listed in `SOURCE_CATALOG.json`.

## Rules
1. **No secrets in git.** API keys only via environment / secret manager.
2. Prefer **licensed / consented / public domain** material.
3. If license unknown: store only short fair-use design excerpts under `excerpts/` and mark `license_class=unknown_review_required`.

# AI Agent Video Production Workflow

> Companion to `human_video_production_workflow.md`. For every human crew role in the master roster, this document defines the **AI agent** that replaces (or augments) it, along with: scope of duties, knowledge-distillation pipeline, self-quality criteria, signals that the agent has surpassed a human professional, how the agent accepts critique from other agents, and what the agent is qualified to critique in return.

---

## 1. System Foundations and Reference-Scanning Plan

| Pattern | Purpose | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-Refine** | Agent drafts → self-critiques against rubric → revises | Madaan et al., 2023 |
| **Reflexion** | Agent stores verbal feedback in episodic memory, retries | Shinn et al., 2023 |
| **RLAIF / Constitutional AI** | Reward signal from AI critic governed by a written constitution | Bai et al., 2022 |
| **Multi-agent debate** | Two+ agents argue; judge agent picks the better answer | Du et al., 2023 (LLM debate) |
| **LLM-as-Judge with rubric** | Frozen judge model scores outputs against pre-registered rubric | Zheng et al., 2023 (MT-Bench) |
| **Pairwise preference (Arena)** | Blind A/B vote between agent output and human reference | LMSYS Chatbot Arena methodology |
| **Tool-use / ReAct** | Agent reasons + calls external tools (renderers, validators) | Yao et al., 2022 |
| **Agentic graph (CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph)** | Roles orchestrated as a DAG with handoffs and review gates | CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph |
| **Provenance (C2PA)** | Every artifact signed; downstream agents verify the chain | C2PA spec |

All agents below are assumed to be implemented as orchestrated nodes in a CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph topology, with tool access to generative video models (Sora, Veo, Runway, Kling), TTS/voice-clone APIs (ElevenLabs, Sync.so, Hedra), DCC tooling (Resolve, Nuke, AE via MCP bridges), and a shared critique bus.

### 1.1 Reference Scanning and Knowledge-Synthesis Workflow

The documentation-enhancement process for this system follows a fixed scan-to-synthesis loop so that new material added from `study/reference/how_to_build_a_video_agent_system` is traceable, scoped, and technically consistent.

| Step | Method | What is extracted | Admission rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inventory** | Enumerate all chapters, agent lists, and distillation notes before reading | File coverage map, chapter clusters, missing topic alerts | No section is updated until all reference files are indexed |
| **Cluster** | Group files by function: orchestration, creation, QA, delivery, optimization, training | Thematic buckets and overlap map | A concept must be assigned to at least one workflow stage |
| **Extract** | Pull technical concepts, implementation details, metrics, handoffs, and best practices | Candidate facts, agent responsibilities, thresholds, artifact types | Extract only claims that are specific enough to operationalize |
| **Verify** | Cross-check each candidate against a second reference chapter, an existing section, or a standards anchor already named in this file | Verified additions, rejected assumptions, ambiguity flags | Ambiguous or single-source claims remain out of the core workflow |
| **Map** | Attach verified material to the most relevant section in this document | Patch list by section, table, or phase gate | Prefer enriching existing structure over adding parallel taxonomies |
| **Integrate** | Rewrite affected sections so new detail strengthens architecture, handoffs, and evaluation logic | Updated workflow prose, tables, and shared contracts | Added material must improve technical depth without duplicating nearby content |
| **Review** | Re-read end to end for consistency, completeness, terminology, and factual alignment | Finalized revision set and follow-up fixes | No release until naming, logic flow, and gate criteria are internally consistent |

**Working rules:**
1. Extract concepts under four lenses: **technical architecture**, **implementation sequence**, **quality/compliance**, and **continuous learning**.
2. Prefer workflow-relevant facts over market commentary unless the market fact changes routing, cost, or scale decisions.
3. Record handoff artifacts explicitly: prompts, scene packets, stems, graded masters, manifests, provenance bundles, and telemetry.
4. Reject role inflation unless a new role closes a real gap in orchestration, validation, continuity, delivery, or retraining.
5. Treat delivery packaging, observability, and asset management as system architecture, not postscript operations.

### 1.2 Runtime Production Systems Architecture

| Layer | Core responsibility | Implementation notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Orchestration runtime** | Plan, route, schedule, retry, and escalate agent tasks | PlannerAgent decomposes the brief; OrchestratorAgent executes the DAG; RouterAgent selects agent-model pairs; JudgeAgent arbitrates disputes |
| **Asset and data backbone** | Store every prompt, source asset, derived asset, version, dependency edge, and usage right | Requires immutable asset IDs, copy-on-write versions, dependency-triggered rerender rules, and searchable metadata |
| **Message and state fabric** | Carry critique, job status, render events, and gate decisions across agents | Event-driven bus plus durable state store; every long-running job must be resumable and auditable |
| **Quality and continuity mesh** | Run technical QC, continuity checks, artifact detection, accessibility, and compliance gates | Uses multi-pass validation, temporal continuity scans, loudness and color checks, and role-specific rubric judges |
| **Observability and replay** | Expose live status, failure causes, bottlenecks, and historical decisions | Structured logs, job timelines, gate dashboards, benchmark alerts, and replayable artifact lineage |
| **Delivery fabric** | Package masters into theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, trailer, and campaign variants | Distribution is a branching pipeline with outlet-specific specs, captions, metadata, DRM/KDM, and provenance payloads |
| **Compute and storage scaling** | Match infrastructure spend to production scale without breaking deadlines | Separate interactive generation from batch rendering; autoscale GPU pools; tier hot, warm, and archive storage |

### 1.3 Shared Artifact Handoff Contract

Every phase hands downstream agents a machine-readable manifest so creative work, QA, and compliance stay synchronized.

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **artifact_id / version** | Unique identity for every output and revision |
| **parent_assets** | Provenance links to scripts, prompts, plates, stems, references, and prior cuts |
| **brief_scope** | The exact subtask, acceptance criteria, and target audience segment |
| **technical_spec** | Codec, aspect ratio, duration, frame rate, color space, loudness, caption requirements |
| **rights_and_consent** | License state, likeness/voice consent state, territorial limits, embargo rules |
| **continuity_state** | Character look, props, wardrobe, environment, scene-time logic, and identity hash |
| **qc_status** | Latest L1/L2/L3 result plus six-pass delivery-QC status |
| **target_channels** | Theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, paid social, CRM, LMS, or festival endpoints |
| **provenance_manifest** | C2PA reference, critique log pointer, and final sign-off chain |

### 1.4 Reassessment Discipline

Documentation changes for this system are reviewed as a repeated challenge cycle rather than a single proofread. A 100-pass reassessment can be grouped into the following bands:

| Passes | Primary question |
|---|---|
| **1-20** | Are all extracted claims traceable to the reference set and aligned with the document's structure? |
| **21-40** | Does the architecture describe the real control plane: orchestration, memory, assets, delivery, and observability? |
| **41-60** | Are workflow handoffs explicit enough for implementation, QA, continuity, and compliance automation? |
| **61-80** |

>
> - **Project type:** Emotional inspirational short film (~55–65s) + vertical cutdowns
> - **Theme:** Unfulfilled dreams, detours, and "failures" quietly protecting and guiding us
> - **Style:** Cinematic realistic Chinese life drama; warm golden-hour light; shallow DoF; subtle film grain
> - **Pipeline:** Maps to workflow variant **E — AI Short Film** ([workflows/E-ai-short-film.svg](./workflows/E-ai-short-film.svg))

## 2. Scene-by-Scene Production Matrix

Each storyboard row becomes a **production card** routed through the DAG. Columns map the original (Duration / Shot / Description / 旁白) plus the agent assignments, generation engine, audio design, continuity controls, and QC owner.

| # | Beat | Dur | Shot | Visual Description (model-facing) | Primary Creative Agent | Generation Agent + Engine | Audio Agents (旁白 / SFX / Music) | Continuity Control | QC Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

# VA-Agent-Swarm — System Build Plan

**Document Version:** 1.0 (Ultra-Detailed, Implementation-Ready)
**Date:** May 29, 2026
**Target Build Agent:** **Claude Code** (Anthropic CLI coding agent)
**Authors:** Synthesized for Nicholas (nicholas_hui) from the complete `study/` specification corpus
**Purpose:** This is the **single, authoritative, step-by-step plan** for an AI coding agent (Claude Code) to build the entire **VA-Agent-Swarm** — a 114-agent, hierarchical multi-agent video-production system — from an empty repository to a hardened, observable, production-grade platform.

> **Scope contract:** This document does *not* re-derive the system design. It assumes the design is already specified across `study/` (see [`SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md`](./SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md), [`ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md`](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md), [`agents.md`](./agents.md), and the per-agent functional/technical specs). This plan tells Claude Code **what to build, in what order, with what acceptance gates, and how to use its own tooling to do it reliably.**

---

## 0. How To Use This Document (Read First — This Section Is For Claude Code)

### 0.1 Your operating loop for the whole build

You (Claude Code) will execute this plan as a sequence of **Milestones (M0–M12)**. For *every* milestone and *every* task inside it:

1. **Enter Plan Mode first** (`Shift+Tab` → plan mode). Read the referenced spec(s), restate the goal, list files you will create/modify, and surface unknowns. **Do not edit code in plan mode.**
2. **Confirm the plan** against the milestone's *Acceptance Gate* and *Definition of Done (DoD)*. If anything is ambiguous, ask one consolidated question rather than guessing.
3. **Write the test first** (TDD). Every unit of behavior gets a failing test before implementation. See §9.
4. **Implement** the smallest increment that makes the test pass.
5. **Run the local gate**: `make verify` (lint + type + unit). Never advance with a red gate.
6. **Self-review** using the `code-reviewer` subagent (§2.3) and the milestone's checklist.
7. **Commit** with a Conventional Commit message (§11.3) referencing the milestone (e.g., `feat(m2-orchestrator): ...`).
8. **Update progress**: tick the milestone checklist item in `BUILD_PROGRESS.md` (you maintain this file — see §0.4).
9. **`/clear` context** between unrelated tasks to keep the window clean. Use `/compact` only mid-task.

### 0.2 The "rethink 100 times" mandate, operationalized

The user asked for a plan rethought "100 times with full effort." That intensity is encoded structurally, not as a slogan:

- **§14** is a literal **100-point hardening checklist** (10 themes × 10 checks). The system is not "done" until all 100 pass.
- The reference workflow already defines a **100-pass reassessment discipline** ([`ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md`](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §1.4). This build plan inherits it: every milestone's acceptance is re-challenged across the five bands (traceability → architecture → handoffs → metrics → wording).
- Every agent you build must clear the system's own **L1/L2/L3 quality framework** and the **Q1–Q6 delivery QC mesh** (§5.5). Quality is recursive: the system that judges videos must itself be judged.

### 0.3 Golden rules (violating these is a defect, even if tests pass)

| # | Rule | Why |
|---|------|-----|
| G1 | **Contracts before code.** The shared Pydantic contracts (§5) are built and frozen *before* any agent. Every agent imports them; none redefines them. | Prevents 114 divergent message formats. |
| G2 | **Vertical slice before breadth.** One workflow (Viral Hook, archetype A) runs end-to-end through real infra before the other 108 agents are built. | Validates the architecture cheaply before scale. |
| G3 | **Every agent is an instance of one base class.** No bespoke agent loops. New agents are *configuration + rubric + tools*, produced by the Agent Factory (§8). | 114 agents must share one lifecycle. |
| G4 | **No agent talks to the UI directly.** Agents publish to the Event Bus; the WebSocket Gateway fans out. | Per [`ui/architecture_communication.md`](./ui/architecture_communication.md). |
| G5 | **Determinism where possible.** Pin seeds, model versions, and prompt versions. Record them in provenance. | Reproducibility + audit. |
| G6 | **Cost & safety are gates, not afterthoughts.** The LLM gateway meters every token from M3; ComplianceAgent can BLOCK from the moment it exists. | Per spec; runaway cost/safety kills the project. |
| G7 | **Mock external gen-models behind an interface from day one.** Real Sora/Veo/Kling calls are expensive and rate-limited; the `MediaGenProvider` interface lets you run the whole DAG on cheap stubs in CI. | Testability + cost control. |

### 0.4 Artifacts you maintain throughout the build

- `BUILD_PROGRESS.md` — living checklist mirroring §6 milestones and §14 hardening; you tick items as you complete them.
- `DECISIONS.md` — an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) log; every non-obvious choice gets a dated entry.
- `CLAUDE.md` (root + per-package) — your persistent project memory (template in Appendix A).
- `.claude/` — your subagents, slash commands, settings, and hooks (Appendices B–D).

## 1. Mission & Build Philosophy

### 1.1 What is being built (one paragraph)

A hierarchical **multi-agent system (MAS)** that automates/augments professional video production from a client brief to multi-channel delivery. **114 specialized agents** (10 categories) run as nodes in a **LangGraph DAG**, made durable by **Temporal**, communicating creative artifacts via a **Shared Artifact Handoff Contract** and critique via a **CritiqueMessage bus**, gated by a **L1/L2/L3 + Q1–Q6 quality mesh**, observed via **LangSmith/Grafana**, surfaced to humans through a **Next.js 15 console** over REST + WebSocket. Cross-cutting services (Agentic RAG, Research, GCA, Optimization, DIA, Aesthetics, LLM-cost dashboard) provide reasoning, knowledge, creativity, and taste to every agent.

### 1.2 Build philosophy

1. **Walking skeleton first.** Get the thinnest possible end-to-end path alive (brief → 1 agent → artifact → UI event) before adding muscle.
2. **Platform, then agents.** ~70% of the hard engineering is the *platform* (orchestration, contracts, QC, observability, gateway). Agents are mostly declarative once the platform is right.
3. **Factory over hand-craft.** After the platform and 5 reference agents, the remaining ~109 agents are generated from spec via the Agent Factory and reviewed, not hand-coded loop-by-loop.
4. **Dogfood the Coding Agent spec.** The intended self-building "N1ch01as Architect" coding agent ([`coding_agent_functional_specification.md`](./coding_agent_functional_specification.md)) *is the role Claude Code plays* during this build. Where that spec defines conventions, follow them.
5. **Quality is recursive and measurable.** Use the system's own evaluation philosophy on the system itself: spec-conformance (L1), rubric (L2), preference/behavioral (L3).

---

## 2. Target Build Agent: Claude Code Operating Model

This section configures Claude Code so it builds the system reliably, with high context hygiene and minimal rework. **Set this up in M0 before writing product code.**

### 2.1 `CLAUDE.md` strategy (project memory)

Claude Code auto-loads `CLAUDE.md` from the repo root (and nested package dirs) into context. Use it as the always-on "constitution."

- **Root `CLAUDE.md`** (template in Appendix A): tech stack + pinned versions, monorepo map, the 7 Golden Rules (§0.3), build/test/lint commands, code-style rules, contract location, and "where to find the spec for X."
- **Per-package `CLAUDE.md`**: each `packages/*` and `services/*` gets a short `CLAUDE.md` describing its responsibility, public API, and local test command. Nested files load when you work in that subtree, keeping context tight.
- **Keep it lean.** `CLAUDE.md` competes with task context. Link to specs rather than pasting them. Run `/mem

## 1. System Overview

The **VA-Agent-Swarm** is a hierarchical multi-agent system (MAS) designed to fully automate (or augment) professional video production — from initial creative brief through final delivery across all distribution channels. The system comprises **114 specialized agents** organized into 10 functional categories, supported by dedicated infrastructure agents, a shared critique bus, and a unified orchestration runtime.


### Core Design Principles

| Principle | Description | Reference |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Agentic Graph** | Agents as DAG nodes with handoffs and review gates | [ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §1 |
| **Self-Refine + Critique** | Every agent drafts → self-critiques → revises against rubric | Madaan et al., 2023 |
| **Shared Artifact Contract** | Machine-readable manifests flow between all phases | [ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §1.3 |
| **Human-in-the-Loop Gates** | Critical decisions escalate to human approval | [agents.md](./agents.md) — ProducerAgent |
| **Provenance (C2PA)** | Every artifact is signed; downstream agents verify chain | C2PA spec |
| **Continuous Self-Improvement** | Agents learn from outcomes, store episodic memory, ratchet quality | Reflexion (Shinn 2023) |

## 1. Design Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Principles

| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Brief-First** | Every production starts from a human brief; UI makes brief-entry the gravity center |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | 114 agents are overwhelming; show only what the current phase needs |
| **Live DAG Visibility** | The Composition Diagram runs in real-time; users must see agent state at a glance |
| **Gate-Driven Confidence** | GateKeeperAgent phase transitions surface as explicit approval moments in the UI |
| **Critique Transparency** | Every agent critique message is viewable, searchable, and actionable |
| **Production-Type Aware** | The 10 workflow templates (A–J) shape which agents activate and which panels appear |

### 1.2 Target Users

| Persona | Needs |
|---------|-------|
| **Creator** | Start production fast, review outputs, approve gates |
| **Producer** | Monitor budget/schedule, resolve escalations, manage team |
| **Technical Operator** | Tune prompts, inspect agent logs, manage model routing |
| **Reviewer/Client** | View deliverables, leave feedback, approve final |

---


## Responsibility

Voice + likeness selection; audition simulation

## Knowledge distillation sources

CSA Artios archive; SAG-AFTRA AI rider; consented voice-actor corpora

## Self-quality criteria

Character-voice fit (audience preference); consent compliance 100%

## Surpass-human signal

Beats CSA casting in blind preference; hours vs weeks turnaround

## Critique bus

- **Accepts critique from:** DirectorAgent, ShowrunnerAgent, Legal/ConsentAgent

- **Comments on:** VoiceCloneAgent (likeness), AvatarDesignAgent

## Tools (design-time documentation)

ElevenLabs v3 voice library, HeyGen avatar catalogue, speaker-embedding similarity (Resemblyzer)

**Runtime safety:** Host allow-lists are only `agent_spec.json` + `tool-permission-register.json`. CI uses video_* stubs. Do not treat design-time vendor names as enabled APIs.

## Architecture pattern

LLM-as-Judge (pairwise preference on voice samples)

## Common structure of an AI agent (full §11 from agents.md)

## 11. Common Structure of an AI Agent

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

### 11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

### 11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |
| 13 | **Critique Outbox** | Peer agents whose work this agent is qualified to review | Defined per-agent in roster. Messages emitted on same bus. Evidence-backed, rubric-referenced, appended to C2PA provenance. |
| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

2. **Cluster / Centroid Semantic Retriever** (RopMura-inspired, efficient)
   - Pre-compute coherent clusters per major subcategory (consistency_systems, prompt_engineering_video, multi_agent_patterns, etc.).
   - Store only centroids + representative files.
   - Query embedding → Top-K centroids → expand to files in those clusters.
   - Great for scaling without broadcasting to entire 5k corpus.

## Migration capability research (v1 honest · 2026-07-13)

Role-specific capability research for **CastingAgent** (`video.casting`, va_id=5, category `1-ATL`).

### Responsibility focus
Voice + likeness selection; audition simulation

### Prompt research topics (source of truth for S3)
- arXiv topics: 1. Retrieve and integrate state-of-the-art research findings from arXiv papers relevant to: voice casting AI, speaker embedding similarity, consent-aware AI likeness systems
- X topics: 2. Analyze and incorporate expert insights from x.ai (Twitter/X) from recognized industry and academic leaders specializing in: AI casting, voice actor AI, SAG-AFTRA AI considerations
- YouTube topics: 3. Extract detailed, actionable technical guidance from high-quality YouTube content created by domain experts focused on: AI casting workflows, voice similarity matching, avatar casting pipelines

### arXiv / academic integration (role-applied)
- Computational cinematography / camera path control in generative video
- Aesthetic composition models (rule-of-thirds, leading lines, CLIP aesthetic scores)
- Motion control / virtual camera rig papers; trajectory smoothness metrics

**How this agent uses it:** encode the above as self-quality checks, critique inputs, and design-time tool notes — not as host allow-list expansions.

### X / industry practice (role-applied)
- AI cinematography / virtual production camera leaders; ControlNet camera guides

### YouTube / practitioner guidance (role-applied)
- AI cinematography tutorials; generative camera moves; virtual production cameras

### Implementation notes for v1
1. Emit artifacts matching role responsibility; self-score against Self-quality criteria.
2. Accept critique only from listed critics; escalate disputes to Judge/Gate as DNA dictates.
3. Design-time tools remain documented only; runtime tools stay in `agent_spec.json`.
4. N1: no second control plane; video logic under `business/video/**` only.

### Research depth note (honest)
This v1 section maps **role-family** literature and the agent’s migration prompt topics into SPEC.
It is **not** a full unsummarized download of every paper/video transcript.
Live primary-source expansion remains a residual for score 100 on S3 where depth is still thin.
