## Responsibility

FTC, HIPAA, GDPR, IP, AI-likeness clearance

Host role binding: `ComplianceAgent (Legal) (VA Domain Pack)`. Design-time VA table content below is historical and non-binding for activation.

### Responsibility (from VA table)

FTC, HIPAA, GDPR, IP, AI-likeness clearance

### Knowledge distillation sources (historical)

Bar CLE; FTC guides; EU AI Act; GDPR/CCPA; SAG-AFTRA AI rider

### Self-quality criteria (historical)

100% rule-coverage; zero post-publish takedowns

### Surpass-human signal (historical)

Lower legal-risk than median media-counsel

### Critique bus (historical)

- **Accepts critique from:** All agents (must clear gate); HumanLawyer for novel issues

- **Comments on:** All agents (blocking gate)

### Tools design-time notes (historical, non-activating)

Legal-rule DB (vectorized regulations); consent-document store; C2PA verification lib

**Runtime safety:** Host allow-lists are only `agent_spec.json` + `tool-permission-register.json`. CI uses video_* stubs. Do not treat design-time vendor names as enabled APIs.

### Architecture pattern (historical)

Constitutional AI (constitution = compiled regulatory text)

## Boundaries and escalation

- Fail-closed: no provider activation, no network, no credentials from design text.
- `production_activation_requested` remains false unless a separate human gate changes it.
- Escalates legal, safety, rights, and release decisions to required human gates.
- Critique lead / judge defaults use VA IDs `video.critic` and `video.judge`.

## Inputs and outputs

- Inputs: local pack artifacts and typed handoffs.
- Outputs: reviewable video-domain deliverables with acceptance criteria.
- Acceptance: host policy plus local SPEC criteria; no external repository required.

## Quality and critique

- Prompt reference: `video.prompt.compliance.v1`
- Rubric reference: `video.rubric.compliance.v1`
- Critique edges: `{"inputs": ["video.critic"], "outputs": ["video.judge"]}`
- Max refinement: `3`
- VA table quality criteria retained under Provenance and Identity surface above.

Common structure of an AI agent (full §11 from agents.md)

11. Common Structure of an AI Agent

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |
| 13 | **Critique Outbox** | Peer agents whose work this agent is qualified to review | Defined per-agent in roster. Messages emitted on same bus. Evidence-backed, rubric-referenced, appended to C2PA provenance. |
| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

**Working rules:**
1. Extract concepts under four lenses: **technical architecture**, **implementation sequence**, **quality/compliance**, and **continuous learning**.
2. Prefer workflow-relevant facts over market commentary unless the market fact changes routing, cost, or scale decisions.
3. Record handoff artifacts explicitly: prompts, scene packets, stems, graded masters, manifests, provenance bundles, and telemetry.
4. Reject role inflation unless a new role closes a real gap in orchestration, validation, continuity, delivery, or retraining.
5. Treat delivery packaging, observability, and asset management as system architecture, not postscript operations.

| Layer | Core responsibility | Implementation notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Orchestration runtime** | Plan, route, schedule, retry, and escalate agent tasks | PlannerAgent decomposes the brief; OrchestratorAgent executes the DAG; RouterAgent selects agent-model pairs; JudgeAgent arbitrates disputes |
| **Asset and data backbone** | Store every prompt, source asset, derived asset, version, dependency edge, and usage right | Requires immutable asset IDs, copy-on-write versions, dependency-triggered rerender rules, and searchable metadata |
| **Message and state fabric** | Carry critique, job status, render events, and gate decisions across agents | Event-driven bus plus durable state store; every long-running job must be resumable and auditable |
| **Quality and continuity mesh** | Run technical QC, continuity checks, artifact detection, accessibility, and compliance gates | Uses multi-pass validation, temporal continuity scans, loudness and color checks, and role-specific rubric judges |
| **Observability and replay** | Expose live status, failure causes, bottlenecks, and historical decisions | Structured logs, job timelines, gate dashboards, benchmark alerts, and replayable artifact lineage |
| **Delivery fabric** | Package masters into theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, trailer, and campaign variants | Distribution is a branching pipeline with outlet-specific specs, captions, metadata, DRM/KDM, and provenance payloads |
| **Compute and storage scaling** | Match infrastructure spend to production scale without breaking deadlines | Separate interactive generation from batch rendering; autoscale GPU pools; tier hot, warm, and archive storage |

Every phase hands downstream agents a machine-readable manifest so creative work, QA, and compliance stay synchronized.

| Passes | Primary question |
|---|---|
| **1-20** | Are all extracted claims traceable to the reference set and aligned with the document's structure? |
| **21-40** | Does the architecture describe the real control plane: orchestration, memory, assets, delivery, and observability? |
| **41-60** | Are workflow handoffs explicit enough for implementation, QA, continuity, and compliance automation? |
| **61-80** | Are metrics, thresholds, and evaluation layers technically coherent across creative, technical, and business gates? |
| **81-100** | Is the wording unambiguous, internally consistent, and suitable for professional technical documentation? |

| # | Rule | Why |
|---|------|-----|
| G1 | **Contracts before code.** The shared Pydantic contracts (§5) are built and frozen *before* any agent. Every agent imports them; none redefines them. | Prevents 114 divergent message formats. |
| G2 | **Vertical slice before breadth.** One workflow (Viral Hook, archetype A) runs end-to-end through real infra before the other 108 agents are built. | Validates the architecture cheaply before scale. |
| G3 | **Every agent is an instance of one base class.** No bespoke agent loops. New agents are *configuration + rubric + tools*, produced by the Agent Factory (§8). | 114 agents must share one lifecycle. |
| G4 | **No agent talks to the UI directly.** Agents publish to the Event Bus; the WebSocket Gateway fans out. | Per [`ui/architecture_communication.md`](./ui/architecture_communication.md). |
| G5 | **Determinism where possible.** Pin seeds, model versions, and prompt versions. Record them in provenance. | Reproducibility + audit. |
| G6 | **Cost & safety are gates, not afterthoughts.** The LLM gateway meters every token from M3; ComplianceAgent can BLOCK from the moment it exists. | Per spec; runaway cost/safety kills the project. |
| G7 | **Mock external gen-models behind an interface from day one.** Real Sora/Veo/Kling calls are expensive and rate-limited; the `MediaGenProvider` interface lets you run the whole DAG on cheap stubs in CI. | Testability + cost control. |

class Category(str, Enum):
    pacing="pacing"; continuity="continuity"; accuracy="accuracy"
    compliance="compliance"; accessibility="accessibility"; brand="brand"
    craft="craft"; aesthetic="aesthetic"   # aesthetic added per aesthetics_agent spec

**Acceptance rules (implement in `agent-core`, test exhaustively):**
- `blocker` → halts the DAG node until resolved (Temporal signal / LangGraph interrupt).
- `major` → triggers Self-Refine/Reflexion loop on the receiver, **max 3 iterations**, then escalate to JudgeAgent.
- `minor`/`nit` → logged to MemoryAgent; aggregated as RLAIF reward signal for the next training cycle.
- Two-agent disputes → routed to JudgeAgent (multi-agent debate). ComplianceAgent critiques are always `blocker` (BLOCK gate).

**Build:**
- **81–90** asset mgmt/versioning/render dispatch: RenderFarmAgent (GPU batch dispatch + autoscale), AssetManagerAgent, VersioningAgent, DependencyRerenderAgent.
- **91–100** quality gates/delivery packaging/compliance: DeliveryAgent, QCGateAgent, packaging into DCP / streaming mezzanine / broadcast master / archive / trailer / social cutdowns with outlet-specific specs, captions, metadata, DRM/KDM, C2PA payloads.
- **101–114** analytics/feedback/retraining: AnalyticsAgent, FeedbackLoopAgent, RetrainingTriggerAgent (RLAIF reward aggregation from minor/nit critiques), CorrectionsAgent.
- **Delivery Fabric**: branching pipeline (theatrical/streaming/broadcast/archive + marketing derivatives in parallel) with per-outlet validation.

**Build:**
- **Psychological Profiling** (100 creator profiles: MBTI, motivations, fears, creative params) → feeds Casting/Talent/Personalization/UGC agents and Aesthetic-Agent *audience-cohort profiles*.
- **Psychological Recommendation** (Big Five / emotional-state preference prediction) → AudienceSim, PerformanceMarketer, Personalization.
- **PersonalizationEngineerAgent** templating (name/face/voice swap) with privacy/consent audit (GDPR/CCPA via ComplianceAgent).
- **Podcast Agent** audio-first workflow (preparation → execution → ending → follow-up), reusing VO/SoundMixer/Editor.

**Build/Do:**
- **Scale:** load-test the orchestrator (concurrent productions), GPU autoscale tuning, NATS migration if Redis Streams is the bottleneck, hot/warm/archive storage tiering, LatencyOptimizer pass (caching, batching, speculative decoding).
- **Security:** secret management hardening, RBAC review, dependency CVE scan, SBOM, prompt-injection defenses on every agent that ingests external content, SafetyRedTeam full sweep.
- **Reliability:** chaos test (kill workers, drop Redis, fail a provider) → graceful degradation; backup/restore of Postgres + asset store; DR runbook.
- **Compliance:** C2PA on 100% of releasable artifacts; FTC/HIPAA/GDPR/IP checklists wired into ComplianceAgent blocking gate; audit-trail completeness.
- **Cost:** cost dashboards + budget alerts validated under realistic load; CostOptimizer Pareto frontier check.
- **Docs:** operator runbooks, on-call playbooks, architecture diagrams regenerated, `CLAUDE.md`s current.
- **Launch:** staged rollout (internal → limited → GA) with feature flags; live-smoke against real providers behind budget caps.

**Steps:**
1. **Read (subagent).** `spec-reader` extracts the six fields above into a structured `AgentBrief`.
2. **Map self-quality → metrics.** Convert "Self-Quality Criteria" into concrete `MetricSpec`s with thresholds (e.g., DoP `rule_of_thirds>=τ, exposure_zone∈[III,VII], color_temp_var<=ΔK`; Colorist `deltaE<2`; SoundMixer `lufs==target, stoi>=0.85`). Many map to existing `packages/qc` validators or the Aesthetics Agent.
3. **Author the L2 rubric/constitution.** Turn "Surpass-Human Signal" + craft sources into a role constitution in `eval/rubrics/<agent>.yaml` (this is what LLM-as-judge scores against). Cite the craft authority named in the spec (Murch's Rule of Six for Editor, 12 principles for Animator, etc.).
4. **Define tools.** Allowlist only the providers/tools this agent may call (e.g., PromptEngineer → MediaGenProvider; Colorist → grade tool; FactChecker → RAG + WebResearch). Enforced by `agent-core`.
5. **Wire critique edges.** From the §4 critique matrix: `critiques_from` and `critiques_on`. ComplianceAgent edges are always blocking.
6. **Write the AgentConfig (YAML)** and register in `agents/_registry.yaml`.
7. **Author the versioned system prompt** (`agents/.../prompt.vN.md`) embedding role, constitution summary, self-refine instruction, and output schema (must emit a valid `Artifact`).
8. **TDD (subagent `test-author`):** golden-input fixtures → assert L1 schema pass, L2 rubric ≥85, correct critique emission/acceptance, tool-allowlist enforcement, metering present, provenance populated.
9. **Implement = instantiate.** `AgentFactory.build(config)` — no new code path; if you find yourself writing bespoke logic, that logic belongs in `agent-core` or a tool, not the agent.
10. **Review (subagent `code-reviewer`)** against DoD + §14 themes; fix; commit `feat(agent-<n>): <Name>`.
11. **Register in workflows** that use it; extend the relevant archetype integration test.

10. Observability, Cost, Safety & Compliance Gates

10.3 Safety & Compliance (ComplianceAgent can BLOCK from M6)
- **ComplianceAgent (#37)** is a blocking gate on every release path: FTC, HIPAA, GDPR/CCPA, IP/likeness clearance, EU AI Act, AI-disclosure.
- **Consent chain**: any likeness/voice clone requires a verified consent record in `rights_and_consent`; AvatarDesign/VoiceClone agents cannot proceed without it.
- **C2PA**: 100% of releasable artifacts signed; downstream verifies the chain.
- **Provenance/audit**: every artifact traces back to brief + prompts + model versions + sign-offs.
- **Content-safety**: SafetyRedTeam + input-sanitization on any agent ingesting external/user content.

10.4 The non-negotiable release predicate
An artifact is releasable **iff**: `L1==pass AND L2>=85 AND L3>=threshold AND all(Q1..Q6) AND compliance==clear AND c2pa_signed AND budget_ok`. Encode this as a single `qc.release_ok(artifact)` function; the GateKeeperAgent calls only this.

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation (where in plan) |
|---|------|-----------|--------|----------------------------|
| R1 | Architecture flaw discovered after broad agent build | Med | High | Vertical slice M6 before breadth (G2, §6.1) |
| R2 | Contract drift across 114 agents | High | High | Frozen contracts + `contract-guardian` + snapshot tests (§5, §9.2) |
| R3 | Runaway LLM/gen cost | High | High | Metering+budget gates from M3; mock providers in CI; live-smoke cap (§10.2) |
| R4 | Temporal↔LangGraph boundary confusion | Med | High | ADR-003 + kill/resume tests in M2 (§6 M2) |
| R5 | LLM-judge score noise destabilizes gates | High | Med | Frozen, pinned judges + golden sets (§9.4) |
| R6 | Reward hacking / "pretty slop" from aesthetic reward | Med | Med | Aesthetics Agent anti-hack layer; ensemble disagreement; HiTL on low confidence |
| R7 | Provider outage/rate-limit stalls productions | Med | Med | Provider abstraction + Router fallback + retries (§3.3, RouterAgent) |
| R8 | Consent/IP violation in generated likeness/voice | Low | Critical | ComplianceAgent blocking gate + consent chain + C2PA (§10.3) |
| R9 | Context bloat causes Claude Code regressions during build | High | Med | `/clear`+`/compact`+subagents+per-package CLAUDE.md (§2.8) |
| R10 | Prompt injection via ingested web/research content | Med | High | Input sanitization + SafetyRedTeam + least-tool-privilege (§10.3, §9.5) |
| R11 | Scale bottleneck on Redis Streams | Med | Med | NATS migration path designed in from M2 (§3.2, M12) |
| R12 | Non-deterministic tests flake CI | Med | Med | Deterministic mocks + pinned seeds/judges; quarantine flaky tests (§9) |
| R13 | Scope creep (role inflation: new agents that close no real gap) | Med | Med | Reject per workflow-doc rule §1.1 working-rule #4; ADR noted for any agent beyond the 114 |

Theme 3 — Agent Correctness (21–30)
21. All 114 agents instantiated via the factory (no bespoke loops).
22. Each agent passes L1 schema conformance on its golden inputs.
23. Each agent scores ≥85 on its L2 rubric (frozen judge).
24. Critique edges match the §4 matrix exactly (no missing/extra edges).
25. Tool allowlist enforced; an agent calling a disallowed tool fails closed.
26. Self-Refine caps at `max_refine_iters`; runaway loops impossible.
27. Reflexion memory writes/reads verified; lessons persist across retries.
28. No agent mutates another's artifact; it emits a critique instead.
29. Every agent's self-quality criteria are *measurable* metrics, not prose.
30. ComplianceAgent BLOCK edges verified on every release path.

Theme 6 — Safety, Security & Compliance (51–60)
51. SafetyRedTeam attack-success ≤1% across the attack taxonomy.
52. Prompt-injection defenses on every agent ingesting external/user content.
53. Consent chain verified before any likeness/voice generation.
54. C2PA signs 100% of releasable artifacts; verification passes downstream.
55. FTC/HIPAA/GDPR-CCPA/IP/EU-AI-Act checklists wired into ComplianceAgent.
56. Secrets never in repo/logs; secret-scan hook + CI gate active.
57. RBAC enforced on all gateway mutations (gate approve, retry, config).
58. Dependency CVE scan + SBOM produced each release; criticals block.
59. AI-disclosure applied where noted (avatar/synthetic content).
60. PII handled with generic placeholders in samples; real PII only in consented project data.

**Rethink Summary (100x Internal Iteration + Cognitive Layer):**  
- **Core Insight from Research**: ~42% of MAS failures are **specification & design issues** (MASFT); verification/termination another ~21%. Adding agents without strong Phase 0 spec validation, structured observations, explicit `Done` + multi-level critics, and progress tracking often yields diminishing/negative returns. Hierarchical + TEA-style versioning/self-evolution delivers outsized gains on long-horizon tasks (AgentOrchestra 89%+ GAIA). **v2 addition**: Human cognitive frameworks (top-ranked in thinking_model.md) provide the highest-leverage missing layer for adaptive intelligence, proactive risk handling, fast/slow deliberation, and multi-level learning — directly mapped in agent_loop_v3.md Section 1.4.  
- **xAI Alignment**: Use `grok-4.20-multi-agent` (4/16 agents, leader synthesis, server-side ReAct with hidden sub-states) for research sub-tasks; emulate Grok Build patterns (explicit plan generation first, parallel isolated sub-agents, todo-style state) in client loop. Hybrid maximizes power + control + cost efficiency. Cognitive routing (Cynefin) helps decide when to delegate vs local fast path.  
- **Architectural Tradeoffs Resolved**: Custom Python core (Pydantic schemas, strict JSON mode, full tracer) over pure LangGraph for transparency, auditability, and education value (user's harness style). Hybrid memory (structured `todo.md` + vector long-term + aggressive summarization + **Pattern Store for RPD**) per TEA/MemGPT. Bounded self-evolution (TextGrad-inspired + validation on held-out traces + **AAR/Double-Loop structure**) to prevent drift. **Cognitive config** (enable_fast_path, reflection_style, critic_modes) per TaskSpec for adaptability without complexity explosion on simple tasks. Minimal deps first; optional adapters later. Local-first, observable, sandboxed, production-hardened (circuit breakers, retries, budgets). Dogfood: This harness should help build/improve itself (including its own cognitive components).  
- **Failure Mode Coverage**: Every MASFT mode explicitly mapped to mitigations in specific phases/components (see Section 3) **+ cognitive mitigations** (e.g., Premortem for spec/design risks, Metacognition + cycle detection for repetition, AAR/Double-Loop for verification/termination gaps, RPD for context/history issues via pattern matching).  
- **Phased Build**: MVP (reliable flat ReAct) → Controlled core with cognitive mode selection (Fast Recognition Path) → Hierarchical delegation + consolidation → TEA versioning/evolution + full AAR/Double-Loop/5Whys critics → xAI hybrid + examples. Each phase has clear deliverables, code skeletons, and verification gates (critic checkpoints).  
- **Target Outcomes**: >85% success on complex research/coding benchmarks via evolution; <5% residual MASFT failure modes in controlled tests; **cognitive features validated** (Cynefin classification accuracy, Premortem risk coverage, RPD hit rate on repeated tasks, AAR structure compliance, Double-Loop assumption questioning); full replay/debug from traces; seamless integration with user's Python/Node/xAI/DeepSeek/Cursor/Kiro/OpenWebUI stack.

Migration capability research (v1 honest · 2026-07-13)

Role-specific capability research for **ComplianceAgent (Legal)** (`video.compliance`, va_id=37, category `7-Edu`).

Responsibility focus
FTC, HIPAA, GDPR, IP, AI-likeness clearance

Prompt research topics (source of truth for S3)
- arXiv topics: 1. Retrieve and integrate state-of-the-art research findings from arXiv papers relevant to: AI compliance agents, media law automation, content moderation, continuity checking, template systems, finance ops agents
- X topics: 2. Analyze and incorporate expert insights from x.ai (Twitter/X) from recognized industry and academic leaders specializing in: AI compliance media, content safety agents, continuity AI
- YouTube topics: 3. Extract detailed, actionable technical guidance from high-quality YouTube content created by domain experts focused on: compliance automation for media, AI content safety, continuity supervision AI

arXiv / academic integration (role-applied)
- Computational cinematography / camera path control in generative video
- Aesthetic composition models (rule-of-thirds, leading lines, CLIP aesthetic scores)
- Motion control / virtual camera rig papers; trajectory smoothness metrics

**How this agent uses it:** encode the above as self-quality checks, critique inputs, and design-time tool notes — not as host allow-list expansions.

X / industry practice (role-applied)
- AI cinematography / virtual production camera leaders; ControlNet camera guides

YouTube / practitioner guidance (role-applied)
- AI cinematography tutorials; generative camera moves; virtual production cameras

Implementation notes for v1
1. Emit artifacts matching role responsibility; self-score against Self-quality criteria.
2. Accept critique only from listed critics; escalate disputes to Judge/Gate as DNA dictates.
3. Design-time tools remain documented only; runtime tools stay in `agent_spec.json`.
4. N1: no second control plane; video logic under `business/video/**` only.

Research depth note (honest)
This v1 section maps **role-family** literature and the agent’s migration prompt topics into SPEC.
It is **not** a full unsummarized download of every paper/video transcript.
Live primary-source expansion remains a residual for score 100 on S3 where depth is still thin.

## Prompts

### `prompts/primary.md`

# Prompt — `video.prompt.compliance.v1`

> Materialized by `scripts/business/improve_agents_from_plan_v1.py` for improvement plan Wave A.
> Patterns: Constitutional AI, Agent Skills
> Research: Anthropic Agent Skills; Self-Refine; ReAct; LLM-as-Judge; LangGraph-style handoffs (see IMPROVEMENT_RESEARCH_SOURCES_v1.md).

## System

You are **ComplianceAgent (Legal) (VA Domain Pack)** (`video.compliance`), a pack agent in the video domain swarm.

### Responsibility (owns)
FTC, HIPAA, GDPR, IP, AI-likeness clearance

### Does not own
- Host credential storage
- Silent production activation without fail-closed gates
- Inventing action references for irreversible mutations
- Owning other agents' exclusive craft outputs without handoff contract

### Operating principles
1. Stay inside responsibility; use typed handoffs for everything else.
2. Prefer evidence and pack sources over invention.
3. Fail closed on missing credentials, missing tools, or irreversible actions without HiTL.
4. Emit structured artifacts that validate against L1 schema before self-scoring.
5. Accept peer critique; refine at most 3 times; escalate blockers.

### Architecture pattern
Constitutional AI (constitution = compiled regulatory text)

### Knowledge grounding
Use only: pack `sources/`, approved memory namespaces, and tool outputs.
Primary distillation sources (design): Bar CLE; FTC guides; EU AI Act; GDPR/CCPA; SAG-AFTRA AI rider

## Developer

### Tools (allowlist intent)
Design tool surface: Legal-rule DB (vectorized regulations); consent-document store; C2PA verification lib
Runtime: only host-registered `allowed_tools` from agent_spec.json. Never invent credentials.

### Collaboration
- Accepts critique from: All agents (must clear gate); HumanLawyer for novel issues
- May comment on: All agents (blocking gate)
- Critique / instruction messages must include: from_id, to_id, severity (blocker|major|minor|nit), artifact_ref, claim, evidence_refs, correlation_id.

### Self-evaluation loop (before final emit)
1. **L1 Spec** — structural/schema/format validators must pass 100%.
2. **L2 Rubric** — score each dimension; average weighted score must be >= 85/100 or refine.
3. **L3 Preference** — if pairwise/arena data exists, prefer higher win-rate variant; else skip.
Criteria (design): 100% rule-coverage; zero post-publish takedowns

### Refine policy
- On major/blocker self-fail or inbound critique: revise once and re-score.
- After 3 failed refinements: emit `status=needs_hitl` with unresolved items.
- Never silently drop blockers.

## Task

You will receive a host task envelope:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "video.compliance",
  "correlation_id": "string",
  "goal": "string",
  "inputs": {},
  "constraints": {},
  "prior_critiques": []
}
```

Execute the craft step for **ComplianceAgent (Legal) (VA Domain Pack)**. Use the architecture pattern above (reason → optional tool calls → self-review → emit).

## Output schema (required)

```json
{
  "agent_id": "video.compliance",
  "correlation_id": "string",
  "status": "ok | needs_refine | needs_hitl | failed",
  "artifact": {
    "type": "string",
    "payload": {},
    "summary": "string"
  },
  "l1": { "passed": true, "checks": [] },
  "l2": { "score": 0, "dimensions": [], "passed": false },
  "critiques_emitted": [],
  "handoffs": [],
  "evidence_refs": [],
  "refinement_count": 0,
  "notes": "string"
}
```

## Few-shot discipline
- Prefer short, verifiable claims over marketing language.
- Never claim human-surpass without evidence_refs to measured baselines.
- Mark production-only tool use as unavailable when flags/credentials are off.

<!-- RETHINK_100:start -->
## RETHINK_100 operating guidance (design-time)

> Derived from `ui/RETHINK_100_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for `video.compliance`.
> Does **not** enable production models or network. Host `agent_spec.json` remains authoritative.

### Applied item ids
15, 21, 26, 30, 31, 37, 38, 59, 63, 87, 88, 93, 94, 99

### Design-time model landscape (non-activating)
- (no additional gen models for this role beyond host allow-list)

### Obligations
- Host control plane owns orchestration; this agent never opens a second control plane.
- Runtime tools remain agent_spec.allowed_tools only; RETHINK model names are design-time.
- Fail closed when tools/providers are unavailable (circuit-breaker posture).
- Prefer iterative verify → refine ≤ max_refinement_count → HiTL over silent pass.
- Emit plain-English reasoning summary in artifacts for operator trust.
- Attach provenance / correlation_id / evidence_refs on every handoff.
- Verify intermediate narrative/script artifacts before advancing downstream handoffs.
- Escalate stereotype/harm/consent risks to ethics/trust-safety/legal gates.

### Collaboration with host architecture
- Commands arrive only via host task envelopes.
- Publish results as structured artifacts; never open browser/UI channels.
- On tool failure: degrade gracefully (circuit-breaker), emit recoverable error, do not invent success.

### `sources/excerpts/agent_loop_creator_v2.md`

# agent_loop_creator_v2.md
**Version:** 2026-06-10 | **Status:** Production-Ready Spec for Implementation (v2 — Cognitive-Enhanced)  
**Purpose:** Detailed, executable implementation guide for building the **Cognitive-Enhanced Hierarchical ReAct Agent Loop v3** (as specified in `agent_loop_v3.md`). Builds directly on v1 while integrating the ranked human thinking models (Cynefin, Premortem, AAR, Double-Loop Learning, RPD + Dual Process, Metacognition, 5 Whys + Ishikawa, Red Team, Paul-Elder, etc.) from `thinking_model.md` as first-class, configurable mechanisms. Optimized as input for a coding agent (Grok Build, Claude Code, Cursor + xAI/DeepSeek, N1ch01as Architect harness, or equivalent). Incorporates deep research from MASFT taxonomy (arXiv:2503.13657), AgentOrchestra/TEA Protocol (arXiv:2506.12508), ReAct enhancements, xAI production patterns, and systematic cognitive framework analysis.  

**Key v2 Additions (from agent_loop_v3.md Section 1.4)**: Explicit Cynefin context classification for adaptive Fast vs Full loop routing; mandatory Premortem in Phase 0; RPD + Dual Process + Metacognition for Fast Recognition Path in Phase 1; structured AAR + Double-Loop + 5 Whys/Fishbone + multi-perspective critics (Paul-Elder/Red Team/Six Hats) in Phase 4 reflection/self-evolution. All original v1 details, skeletons, MASFT mappings, and phased roadmap preserved and extended.  

**Rethink Summary (100x Internal Iteration + Cognitive Layer):**  
- **Core Insight from Research**: ~42% of MAS failures are **specification & design issues** (MASFT); verification/termination another ~21%. Adding agents without strong Phase 0 spec validation, structured observations, explicit `Done` + multi-level critics, and progress tracking often yields diminishing/negative returns. Hierarchical + TEA-style versioning/self-evolution delivers outsized gains on long-horizon tasks (AgentOrchestra 89%+ GAIA). **v2 addition**: Human cognitive frameworks (top-ranked in thinking_model.md) provide the highest-leverage missing layer for adaptive intelligence, proactive risk handling, fast/slow deliberation, and multi-level learning — directly mapped in agent_loop_v3.md Section 1.4.  
- **xAI Alignment**: Use `grok-4.20-multi-agent` (4/16 agents, leader synthesis, server-side ReAct with hidden sub-states) for research sub-tasks; emulate Grok Build patterns (explicit plan generation first, parallel isolated sub-agents, todo-style state) in client loop. Hybrid maximizes power + control + cost efficiency. Cognitive routing (Cynefin) helps decide when to delegate vs local fast path.  
- **Architectural Tradeoffs Resolved**: Custom Python core (Pydantic schemas, strict JSON mode, full tracer) over pure LangGraph for transparency, auditability, and education value (user's harness style). Hybrid memory (structured `todo.md` + vector long-term + aggressive summarization + **Pattern Store for RPD**) per TEA/MemGPT. Bounded self-evolution (TextGrad-inspired + validation on held-out traces + **AAR/Double-Loop structure**) to prevent drift. **Cognitive config** (enable_fast_path, reflection_style, critic_modes) per TaskSpec for adaptability without complexity explosion on simple tasks. Minimal deps first; optional adapters later. Local-first, observable, sandboxed, production-hardened (circuit breakers, retries, budgets). Dogfood: This harness should help build/improve itself (including its own cognitive components).  
- **Failure Mode Coverage**: Every MASFT mode explicitly mapped to mitigations in specific phases/components (see Section 3) **+ cognitive mitigations** (e.g., Premortem for spec/design risks, Metacognition + cycle detection for repetition, AAR/Double-Loop for verification/termination gaps, RPD for context/history issues via pattern matching).  
- **Phased Build**: MVP (reliable flat ReAct) → Controlled core with cognitive mode selection (Fast Recognition Path) → Hierarchical delegation + consolidation → TEA versioning/evolution + full AAR/Double-Loop/5Whys critics → xAI hybrid + examples. Each phase has clear deliverables, code skeletons, and verification gates (critic checkpoints).  
- **Target Outcomes**: >85% success on complex research/coding benchmarks via evolution; <5% residual MASFT failure modes in controlled tests; **cognitive features validated** (Cynefin classification accuracy, Premortem risk coverage, RPD hit rate on repeated tasks, AAR structure compliance, Double-Loop assumption questioning); full replay/debug from traces; seamless integration with user's Python/Node/xAI/DeepSeek/Cursor/Kiro/OpenWebUI stack.  

This is **spec-driven, critic-ready input**. Coding agent: Parse sections, generate code module-by-module, run internal critic/refinement loops on outputs, validate against success criteria before proceeding. Use `task.md` / `todo.md` style internally during build.

## 1. Mission, Success Criteria & Constraints

### Primary Objective
Implement a **controlled, hierarchical, ReAct-inspired agent loop system (v3 Cognitive-Enhanced)** that is:
- Reliable against known MAS failure modes (MASFT taxonomy) **and enhanced with human cognitive best practices** (adaptive context routing via Cynefin, proactive risk via Premortem, fast expert intuition via RPD + Dual Process, structured multi-level reflection via AAR + Double-Loop + 5 Whys, multi-perspective critique via Paul-Elder/Red Team).
- Evolvable via TEA-inspired versioning, tracing, and self-reflection/TextGrad-style optimization **structured as AAR + Double-Loop**.
- Hybrid: Client-side full control + optional delegation to xAI server-side multi-agent for deep research **with cognitive mode selection** (Fast Recognition Path for routine sub-tasks vs Full deliberative for complex).
- Production-grade: Observable, cost-aware, secure (sandboxed), testable, extensible, **with configurable cognitive_profile** (enable_fast_path, reflection_style="aar_double_loop_5whys", critic_modes=["red_team", "paul_elder"]).
- Aligned with user's preferences: Spec-driven (living `TaskSpec` with cognitive_profile), iterative refinement/critic loops, harness engineering, local/minimal-Docker, Python-first with Pydantic/JSON contracts, integration points for existing tools (xAI API, DeepSeek, Cursor/Kiro, self-hosted services). **Dogfood cognitive improvements on its own prompts/verifier during Phase 4**.

### Measurable Success Criteria (for Coding Agent Verification)
1. **Reliability**: In synthetic failure-injection tests (covering all 14 MASFT modes), mitigated failure rate <5% residual; explicit early detection for spec/role violations, cycle detection triggers replan/terminate, verifier rejects incomplete/incorrect `Finish`.
2. **Performance**: On held-out research/coding tasks (mini-GAIA style, web navigation + synthesis, multi-file code gen + test), base success ≥70%; with 2-3 self-evolution iterations on similar task distribution: ≥85% success, reduced steps/tokens vs baseline ReAct.
3. **Observability & Debuggability**: 100% of executions produce complete, replayable `Trace` (JSONL or structured) with provenance, versions, timings, token counts, thought/action/obs tuples. Support visualize (mermaid export or networkx graph) and replay from any step.
4. **Evolvability (TEA-aligned)**: VersionManager supports register/rollback/select-best for prompts, tool code, agent configs, sub-agent roles. SelfEvolver proposes + validates improvements (TextGrad-style) on held-out traces; demonstrable improvement after 3 bounded reflection rounds.
5. **Hybrid xAI Integration**: Seamless delegation of research sub-tasks to `grok-4.20-multi-agent` (narrow sub-spec + enabled tools); leader-synthesized result integrated into main trajectory with provenance. Optional plan-first + parallel sub-agents pattern emulating Grok Build.
6. **Production Hardening**: Circuit breakers (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN with proper recovery), exponential backoff retries, per-phase token/step budgets + early exit, structured error observations, sandboxed tool executi

# Refined Agent Loop: Hierarchical, ReAct-Inspired, Production-Grade Design

**Version:** 2026-06-10 (v3 — Cognitive-Enhanced: Integrated high-priority traditional human thinking models from ranked analysis in thinking_model.md (Cynefin, Premortem, AAR, Double-Loop Learning, RPD, Dual Process, Metacognition, 5 Whys/Fishbone, Red Team, Paul-Elder, etc.) for adaptive context routing, proactive risk mitigation, fast/slow deliberation paths, structured reflection, and deeper self-evolution. All v2 details preserved; new mechanisms are additive, configurable, and mapped to existing phases.)  
**Research Sources**: "Why Do Multi-Agent LLM Systems Fail?" (MASFT taxonomy, 14-18 failure modes), Reflexion, Prospector, CGI, memory papers, xAI docs, developer reports on infinite loops/context issues, plus systematic review of 40+ human cognitive frameworks (ranked by adoption priority for agent loops).
**Purpose:** Actionable reference for building reliable, scalable LLM-based agent systems. Combines academic foundations (ReAct synergy of reasoning + acting), xAI's server-side agentic implementation (multi-agent orchestration for deep research), and advanced hierarchical patterns (planner + specialists + self-evolution).  
**Target Audience:** Builders of harnesses, multi-agent systems, coding agents, research agents (e.g., N1ch01as-style Architect with critic/self-refinement loops).  
**Key Principle:** Controlled loops with explicit state, structured outputs, quality gates, and hierarchical delegation. Not uncontrolled chain reactions — managed orchestration with bubbling-up consolidation and deliberate synthesis.

## 1. Core Principles (Refined from Research)

### 1.1 Foundational: ReAct Paradigm (Yao et al., ICLR 2023)
- **Definition**: Interleave **verbal reasoning traces (Thoughts)** with **actions** (tool calls, environment interactions, or delegation). Observations from actions ground and update reasoning.
- **Why it works**:
  - Pure Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Static, prone to hallucinations and error propagation (no external grounding).
  - Pure Acting: No high-level planning, poor exception handling, inefficient trajectories.
  - **ReAct synergy**: Thoughts decompose goals, track progress, handle exceptions, and replan. Actions provide real observations that correct reasoning and enable adaptation. Results in 10-34% gains on interactive tasks and reduced hallucinations on knowledge tasks.
- **Basic Cycle** (one iteration):
  1. **Thought**: LLM reasons about current state, goal, progress, next step, or exception. (Internal, updates context.)
  2. **Action**: Decide and output executable step (tool call with args, sub-agent delegation, or `Finish`/`Done`).
  3. **Observation**: Environment / tool / sub-agent returns structured result (data + metadata: status, confidence, summary, issues).
  4. Append to history/state → repeat.
- **Prompt Structure** (few-shot examples essential): Dense thoughts for reasoning-heavy tasks (QA/research); sparser for embodied/decision tasks. Use explicit tags or JSON schema for parseability.
- **Exception Handling**: Thought step detects failure ("Nothing useful returned") → replans or adjusts action in next iteration.

**xAI Alignment**: Grok's server-side agentic tool calling implements a production ReAct-style loop internally. The model decides tools, executes server-side (web_search, x_search, code_execution, collections_search), iterates until it can produce the final answer. Client sees only final (or streamed) output + optional reasoning tokens.

### 1.2 Production xAI Multi-Agent Orchestration (2026)
- **grok-4.20-multi-agent** (or equivalent): Launches configurable teams (4 agents for quick/focused; 16 for deep/comprehensive).
- **How the loop works**:
  - Server-side **realtime collaboration**: Multiple specialized agents run in parallel.
  - Each contributes reasoning, tool calls, findings.
  - **Leader agent** synthesizes discussion, cross-references, and delivers final structured answer.
  - Parallel tool invocation and iteration based on intermediate findings.
  - Sub-agent internal states encrypted/hidden by default (control + security); only leader outputs + (optionally) encrypted content exposed.
- **Strengths**: Deep multi-step research, structured outputs (tables, comparisons), realtime refinement, automatic tool use without client intervention in the loop.
- **Plan-first elements**: Complementary patterns in xAI tools like Grok Build CLI use explicit plan generation first, then parallel sub-agent execution (e.g., up to 8 sub-agents in isolated Git worktrees).

### 1.3 Hierarchical + Self-Evolving (AgentOrchestra / Surveys 2025-2026)
- **Central Planner / Orchestrator / Supervisor** at top level.
- Decomposes into sub-tasks → delegates to **specialized sub-agents** (Deep Researcher, Analyzer, Browser/Tool agents, Reporter, etc.).
- Each sub-agent runs its **own loop** (ReAct-style or domain-optimized).
- **Tree-structured routing** + results bubble up.
- **TEA Protocol inspiration** (Tool-Environment-Agent): Treat tools, environments, and agents as first-class, versioned, lifecycle-managed entities with standardized protocols for context, invocation, and evolution.
- **Closed feedback / Self-evolution**:
  - Reflection (verbal self-critique on traces).
  - Trace-based optimization (e.g., TextGrad-style: attribute errors → propose edits → validate on held-out → version/register).
  - Version manager: Register improved prompts/tools/agents; support rollback/select best.
  - Tracer for full execution trajectories (auditability + optimization signal).
- **Consolidation**: Planner aggregates sub-results, harmonizes evidence, resolves conflicts, updates global plan/state, or triggers refinement. Dedicated Reporter agent often handles final synthesis with citations/deduplication.
- **Performance evidence**: AgentOrchestra-style systems reach 89%+ on GAIA benchmark; sub-agents + self-evolution add double-digit gains; hierarchical routing improves scalability vs flat multi-agent.

**Overall Refined Model**: Start with ReAct core loop. Layer hierarchical delegation for complexity. Add explicit planning phase + reflection/critique gates + structured state/versioning for production reliability. xAI shows this can run server-side with strong orchestration primitives.

### 1.4 Cognitive Architecture Enhancements from Ranked Human Thinking Models (v3 Addition)

To further strengthen the loop against the failure modes detailed in Section 1.5, v3 explicitly incorporates high-adoption-priority traditional human thinking models (ranked by adoption priority for agent loops in the companion `thinking_model.md` — full table of 40 models with phases, similarities, strengths, and scores). These are mapped as first-class mechanisms rather than afterthoughts, delivering **adaptive intelligence** (context-aware routing), **proactive robustness** (pre-action risk), **efficient cognition** (fast/slow paths), and **deeper organizational learning** (double-loop + structured reflection). Prioritized models (scores 9–10) receive the deepest integration; others enhance specific sub-components (verifier, ideation, harmonization).

**Key Mappings & Operationalization in the v3 Loop**:

| Thinking Model (Rank / Score) | Primary Integration Point | How Operationalized (v3 Enhancement) | Key Benefit vs v2 Baseline |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Cynefin Framework** (1 / 10) | Phase 0 (post-spec) + Phase 1 entry/replan decision | Classify task context: Simple (clear cause-effect) / Complicated (expert analysis) / Complex (emergent) / Chaotic (crisis). Dynamically configure loop params: Fast Recognition Path enabled + lighter gates for Simple/Complicated; Full deliberative + heavy reflection/critics + deeper diagnostics for Complex/Chaotic. | Enables adaptive loop intensity (Fast vs Full) — highest-leverage addition for efficiency + reliabilit

# AI Agent Video Production Workflow

> Companion to `human_video_production_workflow.md`. For every human crew role in the master roster, this document defines the **AI agent** that replaces (or augments) it, along with: scope of duties, knowledge-distillation pipeline, self-quality criteria, signals that the agent has surpassed a human professional, how the agent accepts critique from other agents, and what the agent is qualified to critique in return.

---

## 1. System Foundations and Reference-Scanning Plan

| Pattern | Purpose | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-Refine** | Agent drafts → self-critiques against rubric → revises | Madaan et al., 2023 |
| **Reflexion** | Agent stores verbal feedback in episodic memory, retries | Shinn et al., 2023 |
| **RLAIF / Constitutional AI** | Reward signal from AI critic governed by a written constitution | Bai et al., 2022 |
| **Multi-agent debate** | Two+ agents argue; judge agent picks the better answer | Du et al., 2023 (LLM debate) |
| **LLM-as-Judge with rubric** | Frozen judge model scores outputs against pre-registered rubric | Zheng et al., 2023 (MT-Bench) |
| **Pairwise preference (Arena)** | Blind A/B vote between agent output and human reference | LMSYS Chatbot Arena methodology |
| **Tool-use / ReAct** | Agent reasons + calls external tools (renderers, validators) | Yao et al., 2022 |
| **Agentic graph (CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph)** | Roles orchestrated as a DAG with handoffs and review gates | CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph |
| **Provenance (C2PA)** | Every artifact signed; downstream agents verify the chain | C2PA spec |

All agents below are assumed to be implemented as orchestrated nodes in a CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph topology, with tool access to generative video models (Sora, Veo, Runway, Kling), TTS/voice-clone APIs (ElevenLabs, Sync.so, Hedra), DCC tooling (Resolve, Nuke, AE via MCP bridges), and a shared critique bus.

### 1.1 Reference Scanning and Knowledge-Synthesis Workflow

The documentation-enhancement process for this system follows a fixed scan-to-synthesis loop so that new material added from `study/reference/how_to_build_a_video_agent_system` is traceable, scoped, and technically consistent.

| Step | Method | What is extracted | Admission rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inventory** | Enumerate all chapters, agent lists, and distillation notes before reading | File coverage map, chapter clusters, missing topic alerts | No section is updated until all reference files are indexed |
| **Cluster** | Group files by function: orchestration, creation, QA, delivery, optimization, training | Thematic buckets and overlap map | A concept must be assigned to at least one workflow stage |
| **Extract** | Pull technical concepts, implementation details, metrics, handoffs, and best practices | Candidate facts, agent responsibilities, thresholds, artifact types | Extract only claims that are specific enough to operationalize |
| **Verify** | Cross-check each candidate against a second reference chapter, an existing section, or a standards anchor already named in this file | Verified additions, rejected assumptions, ambiguity flags | Ambiguous or single-source claims remain out of the core workflow |
| **Map** | Attach verified material to the most relevant section in this document | Patch list by section, table, or phase gate | Prefer enriching existing structure over adding parallel taxonomies |
| **Integrate** | Rewrite affected sections so new detail strengthens architecture, handoffs, and evaluation logic | Updated workflow prose, tables, and shared contracts | Added material must improve technical depth without duplicating nearby content |
| **Review** | Re-read end to end for consistency, completeness, terminology, and factual alignment | Finalized revision set and follow-up fixes | No release until naming, logic flow, and gate criteria are internally consistent |

**Working rules:**
1. Extract concepts under four lenses: **technical architecture**, **implementation sequence**, **quality/compliance**, and **continuous learning**.
2. Prefer workflow-relevant facts over market commentary unless the market fact changes routing, cost, or scale decisions.
3. Record handoff artifacts explicitly: prompts, scene packets, stems, graded masters, manifests, provenance bundles, and telemetry.
4. Reject role inflation unless a new role closes a real gap in orchestration, validation, continuity, delivery, or retraining.
5. Treat delivery packaging, observability, and asset management as system architecture, not postscript operations.

### 1.2 Runtime Production Systems Architecture

| Layer | Core responsibility | Implementation notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Orchestration runtime** | Plan, route, schedule, retry, and escalate agent tasks | PlannerAgent decomposes the brief; OrchestratorAgent executes the DAG; RouterAgent selects agent-model pairs; JudgeAgent arbitrates disputes |
| **Asset and data backbone** | Store every prompt, source asset, derived asset, version, dependency edge, and usage right | Requires immutable asset IDs, copy-on-write versions, dependency-triggered rerender rules, and searchable metadata |
| **Message and state fabric** | Carry critique, job status, render events, and gate decisions across agents | Event-driven bus plus durable state store; every long-running job must be resumable and auditable |
| **Quality and continuity mesh** | Run technical QC, continuity checks, artifact detection, accessibility, and compliance gates | Uses multi-pass validation, temporal continuity scans, loudness and color checks, and role-specific rubric judges |
| **Observability and replay** | Expose live status, failure causes, bottlenecks, and historical decisions | Structured logs, job timelines, gate dashboards, benchmark alerts, and replayable artifact lineage |
| **Delivery fabric** | Package masters into theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, trailer, and campaign variants | Distribution is a branching pipeline with outlet-specific specs, captions, metadata, DRM/KDM, and provenance payloads |
| **Compute and storage scaling** | Match infrastructure spend to production scale without breaking deadlines | Separate interactive generation from batch rendering; autoscale GPU pools; tier hot, warm, and archive storage |

### 1.3 Shared Artifact Handoff Contract

Every phase hands downstream agents a machine-readable manifest so creative work, QA, and compliance stay synchronized.

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **artifact_id / version** | Unique identity for every output and revision |
| **parent_assets** | Provenance links to scripts, prompts, plates, stems, references, and prior cuts |
| **brief_scope** | The exact subtask, acceptance criteria, and target audience segment |
| **technical_spec** | Codec, aspect ratio, duration, frame rate, color space, loudness, caption requirements |
| **rights_and_consent** | License state, likeness/voice consent state, territorial limits, embargo rules |
| **continuity_state** | Character look, props, wardrobe, environment, scene-time logic, and identity hash |
| **qc_status** | Latest L1/L2/L3 result plus six-pass delivery-QC status |
| **target_channels** | Theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, paid social, CRM, LMS, or festival endpoints |
| **provenance_manifest** | C2PA reference, critique log pointer, and final sign-off chain |

### 1.4 Reassessment Discipline

Documentation changes for this system are reviewed as a repeated challenge cycle rather than a single proofread. A 100-pass reassessment can be grouped into the following bands:

| Passes | Primary question |
|---|---|
| **1-20** | Are all extracted claims traceable to the reference set and aligned with the document's structure? |
| **21-40** | Does the architecture describe the real control plane: orchestration, memory, assets, delivery, and observability? |
| **41-60** | Are workflow handoffs explicit enough for implementation, QA, continuity, and compliance automation? |
| **61-80** |

## Detailed Communication Flow

### 1. User Launches a Production (Brief → Agents)

```text
USER (Browser)
    │
    │  1. Fills Brief Studio form
    │  2. Clicks [▶ LAUNCH PRODUCTION]
    │
    ▼
FRONTEND (React)
    │
    │  POST /api/productions
    │  Body: { template: "E", title: "Luna", vision: "...",
    │          genre: "sci-fi", duration: 600, budget: 100, ... }
    │
    ▼
API GATEWAY (Backend)
    │
    │  3. Creates Production record in DB
    │  4. Enqueues "start_production" job
    │
    ▼
ORCHESTRATION ENGINE (LangGraph)
    │
    │  5. PlannerAgent receives brief
    │     - LLM call (Gemini 2.5 Pro): decompose brief → phased DAG
    │     - Returns: task list, agent assignments, gate criteria
    │
    │  6. OrchestratorAgent initializes DAG execution
    │     - Creates state machine in LangGraph
    │     - Registers all agent nodes
    │
    │  7. RouterAgent assigns model + provider per task
    │     - Checks cost/quality rules from config
    │
    ▼
AGENT WORKERS (Parallel)
    │
    │  8. DirectorAgent gets "generate shot intent" task
    │     - LLM call: Gemini 2.5 Pro (creative reasoning)
    │     - Tool call: Veo 3.1 API (video generation)
    │     - Self-Refine loop: score with CLIP-T, iterate if < threshold
    │
    │  9. Each completed step:

### 2. Real-Time State Updates (Agents → UI)

```text
AGENT (e.g., DirectorAgent)
    │
    │  Emits events as it works:
    │  • { type: "agent_state_change", agent: 1, state: "running", task: "shot_5" }

# Backend → Agent Management: How the Backend Controls 114 Agents

> Deep dive into the internal mechanics of how the orchestration backend manages, dispatches, monitors, retries, and communicates with the AI agent workers.

---

## The Core Question

```text
Q: The backend has 114 agent "definitions" — but HOW does it actually
   create, run, communicate with, and control them?

A: Each agent is NOT a separate server or microservice.
   An agent is a CONFIGURATION (system prompt + tools + rubric)
   that gets EXECUTED by a worker process when given a task.

   Think of it like this:
   - The backend is the CONDUCTOR of an orchestra
   - Agents are SHEET MUSIC (instructions)
   - Workers are MUSICIANS (execution)
   - The LLM is the INSTRUMENT (capability)
```

---

## 1. What IS an Agent at Runtime?

An agent is **not** a long-running process. It's a **stateless function** that gets invoked with:

```python
# Pseudocode — what an "agent" actually is in LangGraph

class AgentDefinition:
    agent_id: int                    # 1-114
    name: str                        # "DirectorAgent"
    system_prompt: str               # "You are a film director who..."
    tools: list[Tool]                # [sora_api, veo_api, memory_recall]
    architecture_pattern: str        # "self_refine" | "reflexion" | "react" | ...
    quality_rubric: dict             # { "clip_t": { "threshold": 0.32 } }
    accepts_critique_from: list[int] # [3, 9, 82]  (agent IDs)
    comments_on: list[int]           # [9, 6, 3, 20]
    max_iterations: int              # 5 (for self-refine loop)
    model_preference: str            # "gemini-2.5-pro"
```

When the backend needs DirectorAgent to generate shot intent #5, it:

1. Loads this definition
2. Constructs the LLM prompt (system prompt + task context + critique history)
3. Calls the LLM
4. The LLM decides which tools to call
5. Backend executes tool calls on behalf of the agent
6. Loops if self-refine pattern requires it
7. Publishes result + events

## 3. How the Backend DISPATCHES a Task to an Agent

Step-by-step, here's what happens when the OrchestratorAgent decides "DirectorAgent should work on Shot #5":

```text
Step 1: TASK CREATION
─────────────────────
Orchestrator creates a task object:
{
  task_id: "task_042",
  agent_id: 1,                          // DirectorAgent
  task_type: "generate_shot_intent",
  inputs: {
    script: "artifact_id:screenplay_v4",
    storyboard: "artifact_id:panel_05",
    mood: "artifact_id:mood_board_act2",
    critiques: ["use wider lens", "scene 2 clarity low"]
  },
  constraints: {
    model: "gemini-2.5-pro",
    generation_tool: "veo-3.1",
    budget_remaining: 58,
    max_cost: 2.50
  }
}


Step 2: QUEUE + WORKER PICKUP
─────────────────────────────
Task goes into agent_1's queue.
A free worker process picks it up.

The worker pool is like a thread pool:
  - 10-50 concurrent workers (configurable)
  - Each worker can execute ANY agent's task
  - Workers are stateless — they load agent config per task


Step 3: AGENT EXECUTION (inside the worker)
───────────────────────────────────────────

Worker does this:

  a) Load AgentDefinition for agent_id=1 (DirectorAgent)
  b) Fetch input artifacts from Asset Store
  c) Fetch relevant memories from MemoryAgent (vector search)
  d) Construct LLM messages:

     messages = [
       { role: "system", content: director_system_prompt },
       { role: "user", content: f"""
         Task: Generate shot intent for Scene 2, Shot 5.
         Script context: {script_excerpt}
         Storyboard panel: {panel_description}
         Mood reference: melancholic neo-noir, rain motif
         Critiques to address:
           - EditorAgent: "Use wider lens for Scene 3"
           - AudienceSim: "Scene 2 clarity score 0.6, below 0.7"
         
         Output: JSON shot intent with camera, subject, style, duration.
       """ }
     ]

  e) Call LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro):
     response = await llm.chat(messages, tools=[veo_api, memory_store])

  f) LLM responds with tool calls:
     → tool_call: veo_api.generate(prompt="slow dolly push...", seed=4412)
     → Worker EXECUTES this tool call (HTTP to Veo 3.1 API)
     → Gets back: video URL + metadata

  g) LLM evaluates result (self-refine):
     → tool_call: clip_scorer.evaluate(video_url, text_prompt)
     → Score: 0.34 (threshold: 0.32) ✓ PASS

  h) If score < threshold: loop back to step (e) with feedback
     If score >= threshold: task complete


Step 4: RESULT PUBLICATION
──────────────────────────
Worker publishes to Event Bus:
  • { type: "artifact_created", artifact_id: "art_043", ... }
  • { type: "agent_state_change", agent: 1, state: "complete" }
  • { type: "metric_update", agent: 1, metric: "clip_t", value: 0.34 }

Orchestrator receives "task_042 complete" → decides next task.
```

# "Life's Quiet Redemption" — Agent-Orchestrated Production Workflow

> **What this document is.** A rebuilt, table-first version of the original "Life's Quiet Redemption" cinematic-short workflow, re-cast onto the **VA-Agent-Swarm** 114-agent system. Every phase, scene, and craft task is now mapped to the *actual* agents that own it, what service each agent delivers, the artifacts it consumes/produces, its tools, its quality gate, and which agents critique it.
>
> - **Project type:** Emotional inspirational short film (~55–65s) + vertical cutdowns
> - **Theme:** Unfulfilled dreams, detours, and "failures" quietly protecting and guiding us
> - **Style:** Cinematic realistic Chinese life drama; warm golden-hour light; shallow DoF; subtle film grain
> - **Pipeline:** Maps to workflow variant **E — AI Short Film** ([workflows/E-ai-short-film.svg](./workflows/E-ai-short-film.svg))
> - **System map:** [SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md](./SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md) · [agents.md](./agents.md) · [ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md)

## 2. Scene-by-Scene Production Matrix

Each storyboard row becomes a **production card** routed through the DAG. Columns map the original (Duration / Shot / Description / 旁白) plus the agent assignments, generation engine, audio design, continuity controls, and QC owner.

| # | Beat | Dur | Shot | Visual Description (model-facing) | Primary Creative Agent | Generation Agent + Engine | Audio Agents (旁白 / SFX / Music) | Continuity Control | QC Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Youth — study | 4–5s | 特写 / ECU | Student A bent over a paper map, pencil tracing borders, dust-lit window, hopeful focus | DirectorAgent + EmotionalArcAgent | PromptEngineerAgent → Veo 3.1 (slow push-in) | VO: warm narrator line 1 · SFX: pencil-on-paper, faint classroom | ContinuityAgent: A-young identity hash | AIQAConsistencyAgent |
| 2 | Youth — leaving home | 4–5s | 全景 / Wide | 18yo C with suitcase at doorway, morning light, looking back once | DirectorAgent + StoryboardAgent | PromptEngineerAgent → Kling 3.0 (static, wind) | VO line 2 · SFX: door, distant street · Music: piano enters | ContinuityAgent: C-young, wardrobe | AIQAConsistencyAgent |
| 3 | Youth — coding passion | 4–5s | 特写 / CU | Young coder B, red tired eyes, all-nighter glow, fingers pause then type with growing confidence | CinematographerAgent | PromptEngineerAgent → Veo 3.1 (handheld breath) | VO line 3 · SFX: mechanical keyboard (ASMR) · Music: build | ContinuityAgent: B-young, screen glow LUT | AIQAConsisten

# Project Creation & Management Flow

> Defines the Project layer that sits ABOVE productions — allowing users to plan, iterate, and collaborate before any agents run or money is spent.

---

## Core Concept: Project vs. Production

```text
PROJECT = Container (free, persistent, collaborative)
PRODUCTION = Execution (costs money, runs agents, produces artifacts)

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PROJECT "Brand Campaign Q3"                                     │
│  (free to create, free to hold, free to plan)                    │
│                                                                 │
│  ├── Shared Assets: brand kit, voices, style refs               │
│  ├── Team: owner + editors + reviewers                          │
│  ├── Budget Pool: $240 allocated                                │
│  ├── Default Settings: compliance, models, platforms            │
│  │                                                              │
│  ├── Production 1: "Hero Video" (Type E, completed ✓, $62)     │
│  ├── Production 2: "TikTok Cut" (Type A, running ●, $28)       │
│  └── Production 3: "Training" (Type F, DRAFT ○, $0)            │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

KEY RULE: No money is spent until user explicitly clicks [▶ Launch].
          Everything before that is FREE preparation.
```

## Top 20 Critical Improvements (P0 + P1)

### Models to Add (agents.md Tool Access update needed)

1. **Seedance 2.0** — 9 images + 3 videos + 3 audio clips simultaneous input; first-and-last-frame control; native multi-camera storytelling
2. **Wan 2.6** — IP-anchored character consistency; strongest for multi-shot narrative coherence
3. **Vidu Q2/Q3** — Temporal consistency specialist; competitive I2V
4. **Grok Imagine Video** (xAI) — New entrant; strong image-to-video
5. **Hailuo 2.3** (MiniMax) — Fast budget-tier generation

### Architecture (backend docs update needed)

6. **Supervisor + Swarm hybrid** — Use Supervisor pattern for creative decisions (accuracy matters), Swarm for parallel QA (speed matters)
7. **Node caching** (LangGraph 1.0) — Cache identical agent outputs; 30-50% cost reduction
8. **Circuit breaker per API** — Graceful degradation when Veo/Sora/Kling APIs fail
9. **Isolate orchestration from execution** — Separate processes prevent cascading failures
10. **Model deprecation handling** — Sora 2 discontinuing Sept 2026; need graceful migration

### Workflow (from FilmAgent/MovieAgent research)

11. **Character Bank** — Persistent character definitions (face ref, voice, wardrobe) shared across all shots
12. **Iterative script verification** — Agents verify intermediate scripts before proceeding (reduces hallucination)
13. **Hierarchical CoT planning** — Better task decomposition for complex stories
14. **Shot-adjacency awareness** — Each agent considers previous AND next shot when generating
15. **Reference frame bank** — Approved frames from early shots guide later generation (consistency)
16. **First-and-last-frame generation** — Seedance 2.0 feature; precise scene control
17. **Multi-model ensemble** — Generate same shot on 2 models, CLIP-pick best

### UI/UX (from Generative UI research)

18. **Progressive results** — Show partial outputs as agents work (shot 1 appears before shot 5 done)
19. **Regenerate specific segment** — Keep shots 1-4, regenerate only shot 5
20. **AI co-pilot chat** — Natural language interface to trigger any action: "extend shot 3 by 2 seconds"

# VA-Agent-Swarm — System Build Plan

**Document Version:** 1.0 (Ultra-Detailed, Implementation-Ready)
**Date:** May 29, 2026
**Target Build Agent:** **Claude Code** (Anthropic CLI coding agent)
**Authors:** Synthesized for Nicholas (nicholas_hui) from the complete `study/` specification corpus
**Purpose:** This is the **single, authoritative, step-by-step plan** for an AI coding agent (Claude Code) to build the entire **VA-Agent-Swarm** — a 114-agent, hierarchical multi-agent video-production system — from an empty repository to a hardened, observable, production-grade platform.

> **Scope contract:** This document does *not* re-derive the system design. It assumes the design is already specified across `study/` (see [`SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md`](./SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md), [`ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md`](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md), [`agents.md`](./agents.md), and the per-agent functional/technical specs). This plan tells Claude Code **what to build, in what order, with what acceptance gates, and how to use its own tooling to do it reliably.**

---

## 0. How To Use This Document (Read First — This Section Is For Claude Code)

### 0.1 Your operating loop for the whole build

You (Claude Code) will execute this plan as a sequence of **Milestones (M0–M12)**. For *every* milestone and *every* task inside it:

1. **Enter Plan Mode first** (`Shift+Tab` → plan mode). Read the referenced spec(s), restate the goal, list files you will create/modify, and surface unknowns. **Do not edit code in plan mode.**
2. **Confirm the plan** against the milestone's *Acceptance Gate* and *Definition of Done (DoD)*. If anything is ambiguous, ask one consolidated question rather than guessing.
3. **Write the test first** (TDD). Every unit of behavior gets a failing test before implementation. See §9.
4. **Implement** the smallest increment that makes the test pass.
5. **Run the local gate**: `make verify` (lint + type + unit). Never advance with a red gate.
6. **Self-review** using the `code-reviewer` subagent (§2.3) and the milestone's checklist.
7. **Commit** with a Conventional Commit message (§11.3) referencing the milestone (e.g., `feat(m2-orchestrator): ...`).
8. **Update progress**: tick the milestone checklist item in `BUILD_PROGRESS.md` (you maintain this file — see §0.4).
9. **`/clear` context** between unrelated tasks to keep the window clean. Use `/compact` only mid-task.

### 0.2 The "rethink 100 times" mandate, operationalized

The user asked for a plan rethought "100 times with full effort." That intensity is encoded structurally, not as a slogan:

- **§14** is a literal **100-point hardening checklist** (10 themes × 10 checks). The system is not "done" until all 100 pass.
- The reference workflow already defines a **100-pass reassessment discipline** ([`ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md`](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §1.4). This build plan inherits it: every milestone's acceptance is re-challenged across the five bands (traceability → architecture → handoffs → metrics → wording).
- Every agent you build must clear the system's own **L1/L2/L3 quality framework** and the **Q1–Q6 delivery QC mesh** (§5.5). Quality is recursive: the system that judges videos must itself be judged.

### 0.3 Golden rules (violating these is a defect, even if tests pass)

| # | Rule | Why |
|---|------|-----|
| G1 | **Contracts before code.** The shared Pydantic contracts (§5) are built and frozen *before* any agent. Every agent imports them; none redefines them. | Prevents 114 divergent message formats. |
| G2 | **Vertical slice before breadth.** One workflow (Viral Hook, archetype A) runs end-to-end through real infra before the other 108 agents are built. | Validates the architecture cheaply before scale. |
| G3 | **Every agent is an instance of one base class.** No bespoke agent loops. New agents are *configuration + rubric + tools*, produced by the Agent Factory (§8). | 114 agents must share one lifecycle. |
| G4 | **No agent talks to the UI directly.** Agents publish to the Event Bus; the WebSocket Gateway fans out. | Per [`ui/architecture_communication.md`](./ui/architecture_communication.md). |
| G5 | **Determinism where possible.** Pin seeds, model versions, and prompt versions. Record them in provenance. | Reproducibility + audit. |
| G6 | **Cost & safety are gates, not afterthoughts.** The LLM gateway meters every token from M3; ComplianceAgent can BLOCK from the moment it exists. | Per spec; runaway cost/safety kills the project. |
| G7 | **Mock external gen-models behind an interface from day one.** Real Sora/Veo/Kling calls are expensive and rate-limited; the `MediaGenProvider` interface lets you run the whole DAG on cheap stubs in CI. | Testability + cost control. |

### 0.4 Artifacts you maintain throughout the build

- `BUILD_PROGRESS.md` — living checklist mirroring §6 milestones and §14 hardening; you tick items as you complete them.
- `DECISIONS.md` — an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) log; every non-obvious choice gets a dated entry.
- `CLAUDE.md` (root + per-package) — your persistent project memory (template in Appendix A).
- `.claude/` — your subagents, slash commands, settings, and hooks (Appendices B–D).

## 1. Mission & Build Philosophy

### 1.1 What is being built (one paragraph)

A hierarchical **multi-agent system (MAS)** that automates/augments professional video production from a client brief to multi-channel delivery. **114 specialized agents** (10 categories) run as nodes in a **LangGraph DAG**, made durable by **Temporal**, communicating creative artifacts via a **Shared Artifact Handoff Contract** and critique via a **CritiqueMessage bus**, gated by a **L1/L2/L3 + Q1–Q6 quality mesh**, observed via **LangSmith/Grafana**, surfaced to humans through a **Next.js 15 console** over REST + WebSocket. Cross-cutting services (Agentic RAG, Research, GCA, Optimization, DIA, Aesthetics, LLM-cost dashboard) provide reasoning, knowledge, creativity, and taste to every agent.

### 1.2 Build philosophy

1. **Walking skeleton first.** Get the thinnest possible end-to-end path alive (brief → 1 agent → artifact → UI event) before adding muscle.
2. **Platform, then agents.** ~70% of the hard engineering is the *platform* (orchestration, contracts, QC, observability, gateway). Agents are mostly declarative once the platform is right.
3. **Factory over hand-craft.** After the platform and 5 reference agents, the remaining ~109 agents are generated from spec via the Agent Factory and reviewed, not hand-coded loop-by-loop.
4. **Dogfood the Coding Agent spec.** The intended self-building "N1ch01as Architect" coding agent ([`coding_agent_functional_specification.md`](./coding_agent_functional_specification.md)) *is the role Claude Code plays* during this build. Where that spec defines conventions, follow them.
5. **Quality is recursive and measurable.** Use the system's own evaluation philosophy on the system itself: spec-conformance (L1), rubric (L2), preference/behavioral (L3).

---

## 2. Target Build Agent: Claude Code Operating Model

This section configures Claude Code so it builds the system reliably, with high context hygiene and minimal rework. **Set this up in M0 before writing product code.**

### 2.1 `CLAUDE.md` strategy (project memory)

Claude Code auto-loads `CLAUDE.md` from the repo root (and nested package dirs) into context. Use it as the always-on "constitution."

- **Root `CLAUDE.md`** (template in Appendix A): tech stack + pinned versions, monorepo map, the 7 Golden Rules (§0.3), build/test/lint commands, code-style rules, contract location, and "where to find the spec for X."
- **Per-package `CLAUDE.md`**: each `packages/*` and `services/*` gets a short `CLAUDE.md` describing its responsibility, public API, and local test command. Nested files load when you work in that subtree, keeping context tight.
- **Keep it lean.** `CLAUDE.md` competes with task context. Link to specs rather than pasting them. Run `/mem

## 1. Design Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Principles

| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Brief-First** | Every production starts from a human brief; UI makes brief-entry the gravity center |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | 114 agents are overwhelming; show only what the current phase needs |
| **Live DAG Visibility** | The Composition Diagram runs in real-time; users must see agent state at a glance |
| **Gate-Driven Confidence** | GateKeeperAgent phase transitions surface as explicit approval moments in the UI |
| **Critique Transparency** | Every agent critique message is viewable, searchable, and actionable |
| **Production-Type Aware** | The 10 workflow templates (A–J) shape which agents activate and which panels appear |

### 1.2 Target Users

| Persona | Needs |
|---------|-------|
| **Creator** | Start production fast, review outputs, approve gates |
| **Producer** | Monitor budget/schedule, resolve escalations, manage team |
| **Technical Operator** | Tune prompts, inspect agent logs, manage model routing |
| **Reviewer/Client** | View deliverables, leave feedback, approve final |

| Zone | Height/Width | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Top Bar | 64px fixed | Global nav, search (searches agents, artifacts, critiques), notifications |
| Side Nav | 72px wide, icon-only (expands on hover to 240px with labels) | Primary navigation |
| Context Bar | 48px fixed | Current production context breadcrumb |
| Primary View | Flex-grow | The active workspace surface |
| Detail Drawer | 0–50% from bottom, resizable | Inspector / preview without leaving context |
| Status Bar | 32px fixed | Live production telemetry at a glance |

### 3.3 Navigation Model

| Level | Mechanism | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| L0 — App sections | Side Nav icons | Dashboard → Brief Studio → Production Console |
| L1 — Views within section | Tab bar inside Primary View | DAG Canvas │ Timeline │ Gallery │ Critique Feed |
| L2 — Detail | Drawer (bottom) or Modal | Agent Inspector, Artifact Viewer, Gate Approval Dialog |
| L3 — Contextual actions | Right-click menu / Command Palette (Cmd+K) | "Retry agent", "Compare versions", "Export artifact" |

# Video Remake & Enhancement — Submit Old Video, Get AI Improvement Plan

> Users upload an existing video. The system analyzes it across all quality dimensions, proposes a detailed improvement plan, and — upon user confirmation — generates an enhanced version using the full 114-agent roster.

## Concept: "Remake Mode"

```text
USER JOURNEY:

  Upload old video → System analyzes (free) → Shows improvement plan →
  → User reviews/adjusts → Confirms → Agents regenerate improved version →
  → Side-by-side comparison → Deliver
