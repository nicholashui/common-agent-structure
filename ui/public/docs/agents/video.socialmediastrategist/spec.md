## Responsibility

Platform-native distribution, timing, trends

Host role binding: `SocialMediaStrategistAgent (VA Domain Pack)`. Design-time VA table content below is historical and non-binding for activation.

### Responsibility (from VA table)

Platform-native distribution, timing, trends

### Knowledge distillation sources (historical)

TikTok Creator Portal; Meta Marketing Science; Tubular/Sensor Tower

### Self-quality criteria (historical)

Predicted-vs-actual reach error; trend-timing latency <2h

### Surpass-human signal (historical)

Beats agency social leads on 30-day reach lift

### Critique bus (historical)

- **Accepts critique from:** AnalystAgent, BrandAgent

- **Comments on:** CopywriterAgent (off-platform tone), EditorAgent (wrong aspect)

### Tools design-time notes (historical, non-activating)

Meta Graph API; TikTok Content Posting API; Buffer/Hootsuite API; Sensor Tower data

**Runtime safety:** Host allow-lists are only `agent_spec.json` + `tool-permission-register.json`. CI uses video_* stubs. Do not treat design-time vendor names as enabled APIs.

### Architecture pattern (historical)

ReAct (trend search → schedule → post)

## Boundaries and escalation

- Fail-closed: no provider activation, no network, no credentials from design text.
- `production_activation_requested` remains false unless a separate human gate changes it.
- Escalates legal, safety, rights, and release decisions to required human gates.
- Critique lead / judge defaults use VA IDs `video.critic` and `video.judge`.

## Inputs and outputs

- Inputs: local pack artifacts and typed handoffs.
- Outputs: reviewable video-domain deliverables with acceptance criteria.
- Acceptance: host policy plus local SPEC criteria; no external repository required.

## Quality and critique

- Prompt reference: `video.prompt.socialmediastrategist.v1`
- Rubric reference: `video.rubric.socialmediastrategist.v1`
- Critique edges: `{"inputs": ["video.critic"], "outputs": ["video.judge"]}`
- Max refinement: `3`
- VA table quality criteria retained under Provenance and Identity surface above.

Common structure of an AI agent (full §11 from agents.md)

11. Common Structure of an AI Agent

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

![Professional common AI agent architecture diagram](./common-agent-structure.svg)

> **Tip:** view the diagram fullscreen on GitHub by clicking it, or download [`common-agent-structure.svg`](./common-agent-structure.svg) directly. The SVG is designed as a presentation-grade reference for architecture reviews and implementation planning.

11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |
| 13 | **Critique Outbox** | Peer agents whose work this agent is qualified to review | Defined per-agent in roster. Messages emitted on same bus. Evidence-backed, rubric-referenced, appended to C2PA provenance. |
| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

**Build:**
- **Agent Factory** (`packages/agent-factory`): `AgentConfig (YAML) → runnable BaseAgent`. Validates prompt/rubric/tools/QC refs; registers into `agents/_registry.yaml`; generates the per-agent test skeleton. This is the engine for M7–M9.
- **Workflow A craft agents** (subset, via factory): TrendIntelligenceAgent, CopywriterAgent, SocialMediaStrategistAgent, PromptEngineerAgent/GeneratorOperator, AIQAConsistencyAgent, EditorAgent, AccessibilityOptimizerAgent, AudienceSimAgent, AnalystAgent — exactly the crew in [`ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md`](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §3.1.
- **Workflow A DAG** (`workflows/A_viral_hook.py`): Concept → Production → Post → Review → Distribution → Post-launch, with the spec'd critic gates.
- End-to-end run: brief → DIA → Planner builds the A-DAG → agents execute (mock gen) → artifacts flow with handoff contract → critique bus active → QC mesh gates → C2PA-signed deliverable → events on the bus.

Migration capability research (v1 honest · 2026-07-13)

Role-specific capability research for **SocialMediaStrategistAgent** (`video.socialmediastrategist`, va_id=28, category `6-Dist`).

Responsibility focus
Platform-native distribution, timing, trends

Prompt research topics (source of truth for S3)
- arXiv topics: 1. Retrieve and integrate state-of-the-art research findings from arXiv papers relevant to: generative marketing content, ROAS optimization agents, multi-platform distribution AI, brand-safe generation
- X topics: 2. Analyze and incorporate expert insights from x.ai (Twitter/X) from recognized industry and academic leaders specializing in: AI marketing for video, performance creative AI, social video agents
- YouTube topics: 3. Extract detailed, actionable technical guidance from high-quality YouTube content created by domain experts focused on: AI social video strategy, performance marketing with AI, brand systems for AI content

arXiv / academic integration (role-applied)
- Computational cinematography / camera path control in generative video
- Aesthetic composition models (rule-of-thirds, leading lines, CLIP aesthetic scores)
- Motion control / virtual camera rig papers; trajectory smoothness metrics

**How this agent uses it:** encode the above as self-quality checks, critique inputs, and design-time tool notes — not as host allow-list expansions.

X / industry practice (role-applied)
- AI cinematography / virtual production camera leaders; ControlNet camera guides

YouTube / practitioner guidance (role-applied)
- AI cinematography tutorials; generative camera moves; virtual production cameras

Implementation notes for v1
1. Emit artifacts matching role responsibility; self-score against Self-quality criteria.
2. Accept critique only from listed critics; escalate disputes to Judge/Gate as DNA dictates.
3. Design-time tools remain documented only; runtime tools stay in `agent_spec.json`.
4. N1: no second control plane; video logic under `business/video/**` only.

Research depth note (honest)
This v1 section maps **role-family** literature and the agent’s migration prompt topics into SPEC.
It is **not** a full unsummarized download of every paper/video transcript.
Live primary-source expansion remains a residual for score 100 on S3 where depth is still thin.

Platform-native distribution, timing, trends

### Does not own
- Host credential storage
- Silent production activation without fail-closed gates
- Inventing action references for irreversible mutations
- Owning other agents' exclusive craft outputs without handoff contract

### Operating principles
1. Stay inside responsibility; use typed handoffs for everything else.
2. Prefer evidence and pack sources over invention.
3. Fail closed on missing credentials, missing tools, or irreversible actions without HiTL.
4. Emit structured artifacts that validate against L1 schema before self-scoring.
5. Accept peer critique; refine at most 3 times; escalate blockers.

### Architecture pattern
ReAct (trend search → schedule → post)

### Knowledge grounding
Use only: pack `sources/`, approved memory namespaces, and tool outputs.
Primary distillation sources (design): TikTok Creator Portal; Meta Marketing Science; Tubular/Sensor Tower

## Developer

### Tools (allowlist intent)
Design tool surface: Meta Graph API; TikTok Content Posting API; Buffer/Hootsuite API; Sensor Tower data
Runtime: only host-registered `allowed_tools` from agent_spec.json. Never invent credentials.

### Collaboration
- Accepts critique from: AnalystAgent, BrandAgent
- May comment on: CopywriterAgent (off-platform tone), EditorAgent (wrong aspect)
- Critique / instruction messages must include: from_id, to_id, severity (blocker|major|minor|nit), artifact_ref, claim, evidence_refs, correlation_id.

### Self-evaluation loop (before final emit)
1. **L1 Spec** — structural/schema/format validators must pass 100%.
2. **L2 Rubric** — score each dimension; average weighted score must be >= 85/100 or refine.
3. **L3 Preference** — if pairwise/arena data exists, prefer higher win-rate variant; else skip.
Criteria (design): Predicted-vs-actual reach error; trend-timing latency <2h

### Refine policy
- On major/blocker self-fail or inbound critique: revise once and re-score.
- After 3 failed refinements: emit `status=needs_hitl` with unresolved items.
- Never silently drop blockers.

## Task

You will receive a host task envelope:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "video.socialmediastrategist",
  "correlation_id": "string",
  "goal": "string",
  "inputs": {},
  "constraints": {},
  "prior_critiques": []
}
```

Execute the craft step for **SocialMediaStrategistAgent (VA Domain Pack)**. Use the architecture pattern above (reason → optional tool calls → self-review → emit).

## Output schema (required)

```json
{
  "agent_id": "video.socialmediastrategist",
  "correlation_id": "string",
  "status": "ok | needs_refine | needs_hitl | failed",
  "artifact": {
    "type": "string",
    "payload": {},
    "summary": "string"
  },
  "l1": { "passed": true, "checks": [] },
  "l2": { "score": 0, "dimensions": [], "passed": false },
  "critiques_emitted": [],
  "handoffs": [],
  "evidence_refs": [],
  "refinement_count": 0,
  "notes": "string"
}
```

## Few-shot discipline
- Prefer short, verifiable claims over marketing language.
- Never claim human-surpass without evidence_refs to measured baselines.
- Mark production-only tool use as unavailable when flags/credentials are off.

> Derived from `ui/RETHINK_100_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for `video.socialmediastrategist`.
> Does **not** enable production models or network. Host `agent_spec.json` remains authoritative.

### Applied item ids

### Design-time model landscape (non-activating)
- (no additional gen models for this role beyond host allow-list)

### Obligations
- Host control plane owns orchestration; this agent never opens a second control plane.
- Runtime tools remain agent_spec.allowed_tools only; RETHINK model names are design-time.
- Fail closed when tools/providers are unavailable (circuit-breaker posture).
- Prefer iterative verify → refine ≤ max_refinement_count → HiTL over silent pass.
- Emit plain-English reasoning summary in artifacts for operator trust.
- Attach provenance / correlation_id / evidence_refs on every handoff.
- Verify intermediate narrative/script artifacts before advancing downstream handoffs.
- When metrics exist, surface retention/ROAS hypotheses with confidence — never fabricate live analytics.
- Escalate stereotype/harm/consent risks to ethics/trust-safety/legal gates.

### Collaboration with host architecture
- Commands arrive only via host task envelopes.
- Publish results as structured artifacts; never open browser/UI channels.
- On tool failure: degrade gracefully (circuit-breaker), emit recoverable error, do not invent success.

# Source acquisition runbook — `video.socialmediastrategist`

## Purpose
Obtain or refresh knowledge distillation sources listed in `SOURCE_CATALOG.json`.

## Rules
1. **No secrets in git.** API keys only via environment / secret manager.
2. Prefer **licensed / consented / public domain** material.
3. If license unknown: store only short fair-use design excerpts under `excerpts/` and mark `license_class=unknown_review_required`.
4. Update `PROVENANCE.json` with URL, retrieved_at, hash, and license note.
5. Re-run offline golden eval after material changes.

## Design sources (from agents.md)
TikTok Creator Portal; Meta Marketing Science; Tubular/Sensor Tower

## Steps
1. Open `SOURCE_CATALOG.json`.
2. For each source with status planned_or_partial, document acquisition method.
3. Place fixtures under `excerpts/` or `study/`.
4. Update `MAPPING.md` with path mapping.
5. Set `next_review_at` in `DISTILLATION_PLAN.json`.

# AI Agent Video Production Workflow

> Companion to `human_video_production_workflow.md`. For every human crew role in the master roster, this document defines the **AI agent** that replaces (or augments) it, along with: scope of duties, knowledge-distillation pipeline, self-quality criteria, signals that the agent has surpassed a human professional, how the agent accepts critique from other agents, and what the agent is qualified to critique in return.

---

## 1. System Foundations and Reference-Scanning Plan

| Pattern | Purpose | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-Refine** | Agent drafts → self-critiques against rubric → revises | Madaan et al., 2023 |
| **Reflexion** | Agent stores verbal feedback in episodic memory, retries | Shinn et al., 2023 |
| **RLAIF / Constitutional AI** | Reward signal from AI critic governed by a written constitution | Bai et al., 2022 |
| **Multi-agent debate** | Two+ agents argue; judge agent picks the better answer | Du et al., 2023 (LLM debate) |
| **LLM-as-Judge with rubric** | Frozen judge model scores outputs against pre-registered rubric | Zheng et al., 2023 (MT-Bench) |
| **Pairwise preference (Arena)** | Blind A/B vote between agent output and human reference | LMSYS Chatbot Arena methodology |
| **Tool-use / ReAct** | Agent reasons + calls external tools (renderers, validators) | Yao et al., 2022 |
| **Agentic graph (CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph)** | Roles orchestrated as a DAG with handoffs and review gates | CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph |
| **Provenance (C2PA)** | Every artifact signed; downstream agents verify the chain | C2PA spec |

All agents below are assumed to be implemented as orchestrated nodes in a CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph topology, with tool access to generative video models (Sora, Veo, Runway, Kling), TTS/voice-clone APIs (ElevenLabs, Sync.so, Hedra), DCC tooling (Resolve, Nuke, AE via MCP bridges), and a shared critique bus.

### 1.1 Reference Scanning and Knowledge-Synthesis Workflow

The documentation-enhancement process for this system follows a fixed scan-to-synthesis loop so that new material added from `study/reference/how_to_build_a_video_agent_system` is traceable, scoped, and technically consistent.

| Step | Method | What is extracted | Admission rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inventory** | Enumerate all chapters, agent lists, and distillation notes before reading | File coverage map, chapter clusters, missing topic alerts | No section is updated until all reference files are indexed |
| **Cluster** | Group files by function: orchestration, creation, QA, delivery, optimization, training | Thematic buckets and overlap map | A concept must be assigned to at least one workflow stage |
| **Extract** | Pull technical concepts, implementation details, metrics, handoffs, and best practices | Candidate facts, agent responsibilities, thresholds, artifact types | Extract only claims that are specific enough to operationalize |
| **Verify** | Cross-check each candidate against a second reference chapter, an existing section, or a standards anchor already named in this file | Verified additions, rejected assumptions, ambiguity flags | Ambiguous or single-source claims remain out of the core workflow |
| **Map** | Attach verified material to the most relevant section in this document | Patch list by section, table, or phase gate | Prefer enriching existing structure over adding parallel taxonomies |
| **Integrate** | Rewrite affected sections so new detail strengthens architecture, handoffs, and evaluation logic | Updated workflow prose, tables, and shared contracts | Added material must improve technical depth without duplicating nearby content |
| **Review** | Re-read end to end for consistency, completeness, terminology, and factual alignment | Finalized revision set and follow-up fixes | No release until naming, logic flow, and gate criteria are internally consistent |

**Working rules:**
1. Extract concepts under four lenses: **technical architecture**, **implementation sequence**, **quality/compliance**, and **continuous learning**.
2. Prefer workflow-relevant facts over market commentary unless the market fact changes routing, cost, or scale decisions.
3. Record handoff artifacts explicitly: prompts, scene packets, stems, graded masters, manifests, provenance bundles, and telemetry.
4. Reject role inflation unless a new role closes a real gap in orchestration, validation, continuity, delivery, or retraining.
5. Treat delivery packaging, observability, and asset management as system architecture, not postscript operations.

### 1.2 Runtime Production Systems Architecture

| Layer | Core responsibility | Implementation notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Orchestration runtime** | Plan, route, schedule, retry, and escalate agent tasks | PlannerAgent decomposes the brief; OrchestratorAgent executes the DAG; RouterAgent selects agent-model pairs; JudgeAgent arbitrates disputes |
| **Asset and data backbone** | Store every prompt, source asset, derived asset, version, dependency edge, and usage right | Requires immutable asset IDs, copy-on-write versions, dependency-triggered rerender rules, and searchable metadata |
| **Message and state fabric** | Carry critique, job status, render events, and gate decisions across agents | Event-driven bus plus durable state store; every long-running job must be resumable and auditable |
| **Quality and continuity mesh** | Run technical QC, continuity checks, artifact detection, accessibility, and compliance gates | Uses multi-pass validation, temporal continuity scans, loudness and color checks, and role-specific rubric judges |
| **Observability and replay** | Expose live status, failure causes, bottlenecks, and historical decisions | Structured logs, job timelines, gate dashboards, benchmark alerts, and replayable artifact lineage |
| **Delivery fabric** | Package masters into theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, trailer, and campaign variants | Distribution is a branching pipeline with outlet-specific specs, captions, metadata, DRM/KDM, and provenance payloads |
| **Compute and storage scaling** | Match infrastructure spend to production scale without breaking deadlines | Separate interactive generation from batch rendering; autoscale GPU pools; tier hot, warm, and archive storage |

### 1.3 Shared Artifact Handoff Contract

Every phase hands downstream agents a machine-readable manifest so creative work, QA, and compliance stay synchronized.

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **artifact_id / version** | Unique identity for every output and revision |
| **parent_assets** | Provenance links to scripts, prompts, plates, stems, references, and prior cuts |
| **brief_scope** | The exact subtask, acceptance criteria, and target audience segment |
| **technical_spec** | Codec, aspect ratio, duration, frame rate, color space, loudness, caption requirements |
| **rights_and_consent** | License state, likeness/voice consent state, territorial limits, embargo rules |
| **continuity_state** | Character look, props, wardrobe, environment, scene-time logic, and identity hash |
| **qc_status** | Latest L1/L2/L3 result plus six-pass delivery-QC status |
| **target_channels** | Theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, paid social, CRM, LMS, or festival endpoints |
| **provenance_manifest** | C2PA reference, critique log pointer, and final sign-off chain |

### 1.4 Reassessment Discipline

Documentation changes for this system are reviewed as a repeated challenge cycle rather than a single proofread. A 100-pass reassessment can be grouped into the following bands:

| Passes | Primary question |
|---|---|
| **1-20** | Are all extracted claims traceable to the reference set and aligned with the document's structure? |
| **21-40** | Does the architecture describe the real control plane: orchestration, memory, assets, delivery, and observability? |
| **41-60** | Are workflow handoffs explicit enough for implementation, QA, continuity, and compliance automation? |
| **61-80** |

# VA-Agent-Swarm — System Build Plan

**Document Version:** 1.0 (Ultra-Detailed, Implementation-Ready)
**Date:** May 29, 2026
**Target Build Agent:** **Claude Code** (Anthropic CLI coding agent)
**Authors:** Synthesized for Nicholas (nicholas_hui) from the complete `study/` specification corpus
**Purpose:** This is the **single, authoritative, step-by-step plan** for an AI coding agent (Claude Code) to build the entire **VA-Agent-Swarm** — a 114-agent, hierarchical multi-agent video-production system — from an empty repository to a hardened, observable, production-grade platform.

> **Scope contract:** This document does *not* re-derive the system design. It assumes the design is already specified across `study/` (see [`SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md`](./SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md), [`ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md`](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md), [`agents.md`](./agents.md), and the per-agent functional/technical specs). This plan tells Claude Code **what to build, in what order, with what acceptance gates, and how to use its own tooling to do it reliably.**

---

## 0. How To Use This Document (Read First — This Section Is For Claude Code)

### 0.1 Your operating loop for the whole build

You (Claude Code) will execute this plan as a sequence of **Milestones (M0–M12)**. For *every* milestone and *every* task inside it:

1. **Enter Plan Mode first** (`Shift+Tab` → plan mode). Read the referenced spec(s), restate the goal, list files you will create/modify, and surface unknowns. **Do not edit code in plan mode.**
2. **Confirm the plan** against the milestone's *Acceptance Gate* and *Definition of Done (DoD)*. If anything is ambiguous, ask one consolidated question rather than guessing.
3. **Write the test first** (TDD). Every unit of behavior gets a failing test before implementation. See §9.
4. **Implement** the smallest increment that makes the test pass.
5. **Run the local gate**: `make verify` (lint + type + unit). Never advance with a red gate.
6. **Self-review** using the `code-reviewer` subagent (§2.3) and the milestone's checklist.
7. **Commit** with a Conventional Commit message (§11.3) referencing the milestone (e.g., `feat(m2-orchestrator): ...`).
8. **Update progress**: tick the milestone checklist item in `BUILD_PROGRESS.md` (you maintain this file — see §0.4).
9. **`/clear` context** between unrelated tasks to keep the window clean. Use `/compact` only mid-task.

### 0.2 The "rethink 100 times" mandate, operationalized

The user asked for a plan rethought "100 times with full effort." That intensity is encoded structurally, not as a slogan:

- **§14** is a literal **100-point hardening checklist** (10 themes × 10 checks). The system is not "done" until all 100 pass.
- The reference workflow already defines a **100-pass reassessment discipline** ([`ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md`](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §1.4). This build plan inherits it: every milestone's acceptance is re-challenged across the five bands (traceability → architecture → handoffs → metrics → wording).
- Every agent you build must clear the system's own **L1/L2/L3 quality framework** and the **Q1–Q6 delivery QC mesh** (§5.5). Quality is recursive: the system that judges videos must itself be judged.

### 0.3 Golden rules (violating these is a defect, even if tests pass)

| # | Rule | Why |
|---|------|-----|
| G1 | **Contracts before code.** The shared Pydantic contracts (§5) are built and frozen *before* any agent. Every agent imports them; none redefines them. | Prevents 114 divergent message formats. |
| G2 | **Vertical slice before breadth.** One workflow (Viral Hook, archetype A) runs end-to-end through real infra before the other 108 agents are built. | Validates the architecture cheaply before scale. |
| G3 | **Every agent is an instance of one base class.** No bespoke agent loops. New agents are *configuration + rubric + tools*, produced by the Agent Factory (§8). | 114 agents must share one lifecycle. |
| G4 | **No agent talks to the UI directly.** Agents publish to the Event Bus; the WebSocket Gateway fans out. | Per [`ui/architecture_communication.md`](./ui/architecture_communication.md). |
| G5 | **Determinism where possible.** Pin seeds, model versions, and prompt versions. Record them in provenance. | Reproducibility + audit. |
| G6 | **Cost & safety are gates, not afterthoughts.** The LLM gateway meters every token from M3; ComplianceAgent can BLOCK from the moment it exists. | Per spec; runaway cost/safety kills the project. |
| G7 | **Mock external gen-models behind an interface from day one.** Real Sora/Veo/Kling calls are expensive and rate-limited; the `MediaGenProvider` interface lets you run the whole DAG on cheap stubs in CI. | Testability + cost control. |

### 0.4 Artifacts you maintain throughout the build

- `BUILD_PROGRESS.md` — living checklist mirroring §6 milestones and §14 hardening; you tick items as you complete them.
- `DECISIONS.md` — an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) log; every non-obvious choice gets a dated entry.
- `CLAUDE.md` (root + per-package) — your persistent project memory (template in Appendix A).
- `.claude/` — your subagents, slash commands, settings, and hooks (Appendices B–D).

## 1. Mission & Build Philosophy

### 1.1 What is being built (one paragraph)

A hierarchical **multi-agent system (MAS)** that automates/augments professional video production from a client brief to multi-channel delivery. **114 specialized agents** (10 categories) run as nodes in a **LangGraph DAG**, made durable by **Temporal**, communicating creative artifacts via a **Shared Artifact Handoff Contract** and critique via a **CritiqueMessage bus**, gated by a **L1/L2/L3 + Q1–Q6 quality mesh**, observed via **LangSmith/Grafana**, surfaced to humans through a **Next.js 15 console** over REST + WebSocket. Cross-cutting services (Agentic RAG, Research, GCA, Optimization, DIA, Aesthetics, LLM-cost dashboard) provide reasoning, knowledge, creativity, and taste to every agent.

### 1.2 Build philosophy

1. **Walking skeleton first.** Get the thinnest possible end-to-end path alive (brief → 1 agent → artifact → UI event) before adding muscle.
2. **Platform, then agents.** ~70% of the hard engineering is the *platform* (orchestration, contracts, QC, observability, gateway). Agents are mostly declarative once the platform is right.
3. **Factory over hand-craft.** After the platform and 5 reference agents, the remaining ~109 agents are generated from spec via the Agent Factory and reviewed, not hand-coded loop-by-loop.
4. **Dogfood the Coding Agent spec.** The intended self-building "N1ch01as Architect" coding agent ([`coding_agent_functional_specification.md`](./coding_agent_functional_specification.md)) *is the role Claude Code plays* during this build. Where that spec defines conventions, follow them.
5. **Quality is recursive and measurable.** Use the system's own evaluation philosophy on the system itself: spec-conformance (L1), rubric (L2), preference/behavioral (L3).

---

## 2. Target Build Agent: Claude Code Operating Model

This section configures Claude Code so it builds the system reliably, with high context hygiene and minimal rework. **Set this up in M0 before writing product code.**

### 2.1 `CLAUDE.md` strategy (project memory)

Claude Code auto-loads `CLAUDE.md` from the repo root (and nested package dirs) into context. Use it as the always-on "constitution."

- **Root `CLAUDE.md`** (template in Appendix A): tech stack + pinned versions, monorepo map, the 7 Golden Rules (§0.3), build/test/lint commands, code-style rules, contract location, and "where to find the spec for X."
- **Per-package `CLAUDE.md`**: each `packages/*` and `services/*` gets a short `CLAUDE.md` describing its responsibility, public API, and local test command. Nested files load when you work in that subtree, keeping context tight.
- **Keep it lean.** `CLAUDE.md` competes with task context. Link to specs rather than pasting them. Run `/mem

## Architecture pattern

Self-Refine (rubric: Murch Rule of Six)

## Common structure of an AI agent (full §11 from agents.md)

## 11. Common Structure of an AI Agent

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

### 11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

### 11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |
| 13 | **Critique Outbox** | Peer agents whose work this agent is qualified to review | Defined per-agent in roster. Messages emitted on same bus. Evidence-backed, rubric-referenced, appended to C2PA provenance. |
| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

### Crew Scaling Guide *(how many humans you actually need)*

| Production Tier | Example | Typical Crew Size | AI-Augmented Crew Size |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Solo creator short-form** | TikTok meme, motivation clip | 1 person (creator) | 1 person + AI tools |
| **Small-team social** | UGC ad, brand Reel | 2–4 (creator, editor, strategist) | 1–2 + AI |
| **Indie explainer / lookbook** | Animated explainer, fashion lookbook | 3–6 (writer, designer, animator, VO, editor) | 1–3 + AI |
| **Professional commercial** | Brand TVC, product launch | 15–40 (full agency + production crew) | 5–10 + AI |
| **Short film / music video** | Sundance-style short, music video | 20–60 | 8–15 + AI |
| **Documentary / series episode** | Netflix-style explainer ep | 30–80 | 12–25 + AI |
| **Feature film / long doc** | IMDb-credited feature | 150–500+ (per IMDb full crew lists) | 50–150 + AI |

> **Reference**: IMDb full-credits pages for award-winning films (e.g., *Oppenheimer*, *Everything Everywhere All at Once*, *Dune*) routinely list 1,500–3,000+ named crew members across departments. The crew rows above represent the *minimum credited specialists* needed to ship each production type at professional quality — AI tools collapse multiple roles (e.g., DoP + colorist + VFX) into operator + reviewer pairs, but creative, legal, and subject-matter roles still require humans.

> **How to use this table**: When planning any production from the category tables above, look up each crew role here to (1) understand what to hire for, (2) write a realistic JD, (3) know which real-world expert or awards body would meaningfully critique the output and surface errors. Where AI augmentation is available, pair the AI operator role with a domain critic (e.g., AI medical-explainer = Prompt Engineer + Medical Illustrator + AMI peer reviewer) — the critic catches what the model can't.

### Workflow Universals (apply to every archetype)

| Universal Step | When | Owned By | Why It Matters |
|----------------|------|----------|----------------|
| **Brief / one-pager sign-off** | Before any production | Producer + Client | Prevents scope creep |
| **Music & footage licensing** | Before publish | Producer / Legal | Avoids takedowns and lawsuits |
| **AI provenance (C2PA)** | At master export | Legal / AI Operator | Required by EU AI Act, many platforms |
| **Accessibility pass (captions, AD, contrast)** | Before publish | Accessibility Specialist | WCAG 2.2 + ADA compliance |
| **Backup + archival (LTO / cloud)** | At wrap | Post Producer | Future-proofs IP and recuts |
| **Post-launch retro** | 7–30 days after launch | Producer | Compounds learnings into next production |

# "Life's Quiet Redemption" — Agent-Orchestrated Production Workflow

> **What this document is.** A rebuilt, table-first version of the original "Life's Quiet Redemption" cinematic-short workflow, re-cast onto the **VA-Agent-Swarm** 114-agent system. Every phase, scene, and craft task is now mapped to the *actual* agents that own it, what service each agent delivers, the artifacts it consumes/produces, its tools, its quality gate, and which agents critique it.
>
> - **Project type:** Emotional inspirational short film (~55–65s) + vertical cutdowns
> - **Theme:** Unfulfilled dreams, detours, and "failures" quietly protecting and guiding us
> - **Style:** Cinematic realistic Chinese life drama; warm golden-hour light; shallow DoF; subtle film grain
> - **Pipeline:** Maps to workflow variant **E — AI Short Film** ([workflows/E-ai-short-film.svg](./workflows/E-ai-short-film.svg))
> - **System map:** [SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md](./SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md) · [agents.md](./agents.md) · [ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md)

| Service / Capability | Provided By | Role on This Film |
|---|---|---|
| **Aesthetics scoring (Critic + Aligner + Taste-Keeper)** | Aesthetics Agent | Supplies the L2/perceptual "is this beautiful + warm?" judge signal to Cinematographer, Colorist, PromptEngineer, AIQA |
| **Strategic Goal Achievement (6-stage self-inquiry)** | Strategic Goal framework | Turns the vague "make people feel life saved them" goal into measurable creative targets for Planner/Director |
| **Agentic RAG knowledge backbone** | Agentic RAG System | Serves Chinese cinematic references, golden-hour lighting recipes, prompt patterns to any agent on demand |
| **Psychological profiling / recommendation** | Psych Profile + Recommendation agents | Tunes narrator tone and audience-resonance prediction (Big Five / emotional state) for AudienceSim and Personalization |
| **Continuous self-improvement (Reflexion + RLAIF)** | Optimization Agent + EvaluationHarnessAgent (#79) | Feeds 30/60/90-day retention/ROAS back into prompt + edit choices for the next film in the series |
| **Shared Artifact Handoff Contract (C2PA-signed manifests)** | All agents | Every clip, stem, and master carries `artifact_id`, `continuity_state`, `qc_status`, `provenance_manifest` between phases |
| **Critique Bus (CritiqueMessage JSON)** | All agents | Structured blocker/major/minor feedback; disputes escalate to JudgeAgent → HiTL |

---

## 5. Quality Gate Ladder (Per Shot & Per Phase)

Every artifact clears three layers before GateKeeperAgent advances it (agents.md §11.2).

| Layer | Question | Owner / Mechanism | Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1 — Spec** | Did it meet the structured brief (codec, aspect, duration, frame count)? | JSON schema + tool validators | 100% pass |
| **L2 — Rubric** | Does it meet the craft rubric (composition, grade, prosody, beat fit)? | LLM-as-Judge + Aesthetics Agent | ≥85/100 (≤3 Self-Refine iters) |
| **L3 — Preference** | Would the target audience pick this over a human-made baseline? | AudienceSimAgent (#82) pairwise panel + HiTL sample | Win ≥50% (parity) / ≥55% (surpass) |

## 8. Series & Scalability (Reusing the Swarm)

Because the swarm persists character bibles (MemoryAgent #58), identity hashes (AvatarDesignAgent #47), and style LoRAs (StyleTransferAgent #61), a follow-up short reuses ~70% of pre-production. New entries in the 「生活偷偷救赎了我们」 series only re-run Phases 1–4 for new beats, while ContinuityAgent guarantees the recurring "map girl" and "shop cat" stay consistent across episodes.

| Reuse Asset | Stored By | Enables |
|---|---|---|
| Character bible + identity hashes | MemoryAgent, AvatarDesignAgent | Same faces across episodes |
| Style LoRAs + grade LUT | StyleTransferAgent, ColoristAgent | Consistent "warm memory" look |
| 旁白 voice clone | VoiceCloneAgent | Recognizable narrator across series |
| Prompt + seed registry | PromptEngineerAgent | Fast, reproducible re-renders |
| Recurring motifs (cat, paper map) | ContinuityAgent | Audience recognition / brand |

|---|---|---|---|
| YouTube growth | [Colin & Samir — New Rules of YouTube w/ Paddy Galloway](https://www.colinandsamir.com/resources/the-new-rules-of-youtube-from-paddy-galloway) | The highest leverage is *packaging* (title + thumbnail), not production; one creator jumped from ~2–3K to 1M+ views by shifting effort there | Add a **package-first gate** before generation; title+thumbnail decided in Phase 1, not after |
| YouTube growth | [Paddy Galloway strategy summary](https://outlierkit.com/resources/youtube-scriptwriting-methods-compared/) · [Accelerator](https://www.paddygalloway.com/accelerator) | Success rests on idea → title → retention → packaging, using a channel's own data; model "outlier" videos already over-performing in the niche | Add **OutlierModeling** step (TrendIntel + Analyst) feeding idea selection |

| Consistency | [arXiv 2512.16954 — Character-Stable Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.16954) | Removing the *visual anchoring* mechanism collapsed character consistency (7.99→0.55); visual priors are essential for identity | Make **visual-anchor keyframes mandatory** before any I2V; never pure text-to-video for characters |
| Consistency | [arXiv 2510.10135 — CharCom](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10135v1) | Composable per-character LoRA adapters on a frozen backbone, applied at inference via prompt-aware control, raise fidelity without retraining | StyleTransferAgent builds **one LoRA per character age** (A-young, E-adult, …) |

## 10. YouTube Marketing Upgrades (mapped to agents)

| Upgrade | What Changes | Owning Agents | Gate / Metric |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Package-first** | Title (≤50 chars, simple words) + thumbnail concept are locked in Phase 1, *before* any generation; the film is made to deliver that promise | BrandStrategistAgent (#85), SEOAgent (#87), Thumbnail=ConceptArtistAgent (#15), DirectorAgent (#1) | CTR predicted ≥ niche median (AudienceSimAgent panel) |
| **Outlier modeling** | Idea is chosen by modeling over-performing videos in the 治愈/reflective-life niche | TrendIntelligenceAgent (#68), AnalystAgent (#81), IdeationAgent (#59) | Idea maps to ≥3 proven outliers |
| **Engineered opener** | First 3–5s re-cut as a hook: strongest image (Scene 1 ECU or Scene 10 warmth) + a curiosity-gap 旁白 line, instead of a slow fade-in | RetentionOptimizerAgent (#76), EditorAgent (#9), ScreenwriterAgent (#3) | First-60s retention ≥ target band |
| **Segment retention bands** | Map the 60s into hook / build / payoff with explicit retention floors per segment, modeled on MrBeast's segmentation | RetentionOptimizerAgent (#76), EmotionalArcAgent (#65) | Per-segment predicted retention ≥ floor |
| **Shorts 3s-hold cut** | Dedicated 9:16 cut: visual hook on **frame 1**, spoken hook ≤14 words, designed to loop | TrailerEditorAgent (#51), MotionGraphicsAgent (#13) | Predicted 3s-hold ≥60%; clean loop seam |
| **Metric instrumentation** | Track CTR + AVD + AVP as first-class KPIs feeding the next episode | AnalystAgent (#81), EvaluationHarnessAgent (#79) | Dashboard live within 24h of launch |

## 11. Generation Engine Upgrade — Add Grok Imagine to the Stack

The routing in §3.4 (RouterAgent #55) gains a Grok tier. Net effect: cheaper, faster iteration up front; premium engines reserved for hero shots.

| Stage | Engine Choice | Why (cited) | Agent |
|---|---|---|---|
| Divergent draft / variant browse | **Grok Imagine 1.5 Fast** (6s, 720p, ~25s/clip) | Fast enough to try many framings and discard quickly ([x.ai](https://x.ai/news/grok-imagine-video-1-5), [imagine.art](https://www.imagine.art/blogs/xai-grok-imagine-video-1-5-guide)) | PromptEngineerAgent (#46), RouterAgent (#55) |
| Keyframe → motion (identity-safe) | **Grok Imagine 1.5 I2V** (animates the locked keyframe, faithful to source) | Continues the still rather than reinterpreting it, protecting face + lighting ([x.ai](https://x.ai/news/grok-imagine-1-5)) | PromptEngineerAgent (#46), ContinuityAgent (#98) |
| Fast full-film rough cut | **Grok Imagine Agent Mode** (plans/stitches 6s clips, native audio, in-quotes lip-sync) | Produces a stitched draft of the whole arc for early editorial review ([codersera](https://codersera.com/blog/grok-imagine-agent-mode-launch-2026/)) | OrchestratorAgent (#53), EditorAgent (#9) |
| Hero / emotional-peak shots | **Veo 3.1 / Kling 3.0 / Runway Gen-4** | Higher fidelity + camera control for Scenes 1, 5, 10, 12 | CinematographerAgent (#6) |
| Local / privacy-sensitive | **ComfyUI + CharCom LoRAs + IP-Adapter** | Full control, per-character LoRA identity ([arXiv CharCom](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10135v1)) | StyleTransferAgent (#61) |

## 12. Character-Consistency Upgrade (the film's hardest problem)

Replaces "attach a reference image, strength 70–90%" with a research-grade identity stack.

| Technique | Applied To | Mechanism (cited) | Owning Agent | Metric |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mandatory visual anchoring** | Every character shot | Generate a locked keyframe first; never pure T2V — visual priors are essential or consistency collapses ([arXiv 2512.16954](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.16954)) | PromptEngineerAgent (#46) | ID score does not collapse vs anchor |
| **Per-character LoRA (per age)** | A,B,C,E,F,J × young/adult | Composable adapters on a frozen backbone, prompt-aware ([CharCom](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10135v1)) | StyleTransferAgent (#61) | Face similarity ≥0.85 (ArcFace) |
| **RL identity reinforcement** | Multi-person shots (Scene 10 dinner) | Identity-GRPO improved multi-human consistency ~18.9% ([arXiv 2510.14256](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.14256v1)) | AIQAConsistencyAgent (#49) | Per-person drift = 0 across frames |
| **Memory-conditioned generation** | Across all 14 cards | Shot-by-shot diffusion conditioned on prior-shot memory ([StoryMem](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.19539)) | MemoryAgent (#58) + PromptEngineerAgent | Cross-scene coherence pass |
| **Training-free fallback** | Shots lacking a clean portrait | Background+character consistency without references ([BachVid](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.21696v1)) | ContinuityAgent (#98) | Consistency ≥ threshold |
| **Fine-grained ID audit** | QC gate | VLM-based identity-preservation eval beyond global embeddings ([arXiv 2511.08087](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.08087v1)) | AIQAConsistencyAgent (#49) | Fine-grained ID delta below τ |

## 13. Evaluation Upgrade — VBench-Grade QC Scorecard

The §5 gate ladder's L2 is replaced by a multi-dimensional scorecard scored by an MLLM judge (Video-Bench style, chain-of-query) plus motion-perception checks.

| Dimension (VBench/VMBench) | What It Catches on This Film | Threshold | Judge |
|---|---|---|---|
| Subject (identity) consistency | Face/age drift A→E across scenes | ≥0.90 | AIQAConsistencyAgent (#49) |
| Temporal flicker | Shimmer on shop interior / night bokeh | below τ | AIQAConsistencyAgent |
| Motion smoothness | Hands typing (S3), dolly-in (S10) | ≥ rubric | VMBench check ([arXiv 2503.10076](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.10076)) |
| Imaging quality | Grain/sharpness of close-ups | ≥ rubric | Aesthetics Agent |
| Aesthetic quality | "warm memory" look, composition | ≥85/100 | Aesthetics Agent |
| Spatial relationship | Eyeline match S4 monitor reflection | pass | AIQAConsistencyAgent |
| Text–video relevance | Prompt adherence per shot | CLIP-T ≥0.32 | AIQAConsistencyAgent |
| Motion (human-perception) | Natural breath/wind, no jitter | ≥ VMBench band | VMBench ([2503.10076](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.10076)) |

Scoring method: MLLM evaluator with few-shot scoring + chain-of-query ([Video-Bench, arXiv 2504.04907](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.04907v1)), giving diagnostic, per-dimension feedback rather than a single number.

## 14. Orchestration Upgrade — 3E Loop + MCTS Search

| Pattern | Replaces | How It Works (cited) | Where Applied |
|---|---|---|---|
| **3E micro-loop (Explore→Examine→Enhance)** | Single-pass node execution | Each agent first explores options, examines against the rubric, then enhances before handing off ([MAViS, arXiv 2508.08487](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.08487v2)) | Every DAG node (esp. PromptEngineer, Editor, Composer) |
| **MCTS clip search** | Fixed ≤3 re-roll cap | Reviewer agent runs Monte-Carlo tree search over candidate clips to pick the best path ([arXiv 2506.10540](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.10540)) | Hero shots (S1, S5, S10, S12) |
| **Narrative-pacing control** | Manual trims | Keyframe-conditioned pacing knobs tied to the emotion curve ([SmartDirector, arXiv 2605.27891](https://arxiv.org/html/2605.27891v1)) | EditorAgent (#9) ↔ EmotionalArcAgent (#65) |
| **Unified director front-end** | Hand-written shot prompts only | A director model converts the brief into structured multi-shot scripts for non-experts ([UniMAGE, arXiv 2512.23222](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.23222)) | DirectorAgent (#1) + ScreenwriterAgent (#3) |

## 15. Revised Opening & Shorts Cards (concrete deltas)

| Card | Original | Research-Informed Revision |
|---|---|---|
| **Hook (new 0–3s)** | Slow fade into Scene 1 study ECU | Open on the *strongest* warm frame (S10 dinner steam or S1 eyes), with a ≤14-word curiosity-gap 旁白 ("有些愿望没有实现，后来我才懂为什么"), so the first 3s earns the watch ([opus.pro](https://www.opus.pro/blog/youtube-shorts-hook-formulas), [MrBeast breakdown](https://sherwood.news/culture/mrbeast-youtube-leaked-internal-success-document/)) |
| **Title (package-first)** | (none) | ≤50 chars, simple words, locked before generation ([Galloway summary](https://outlierkit.com/resources/youtube-scriptwriting-methods-compared/)) |
| **Shorts cut** | 9:16 smart-crop of main film | Purpose-built: visual hook on frame 1, ≤14-word VO, clean loop seam, optimized for 3s-hold + replay ([rendercut](https://rendercut.io/why-viewers-scroll-away-first-3-seconds/), [findmecreators](https://www.findmecreators.com/blog/youtube-shorts-retention-rate)) |
| **Ending cards** | Static black/white text | Keep — but A/B the *thumbnail+title* pair, not the poem, since packaging drives the click ([Colin & Samir](https://www.colinandsamir.com/resources/the-new-rules-of-youtube-from-paddy-galloway)) |

### From `corpus/study/system_build_plan.md` Copy: `sources/excerpts/system_build_plan.md`.


**Build:**
- **Agent Factory** (`packages/agent-factory`): `AgentConfig (YAML) → runnable BaseAgent`. Validates prompt/rubric/tools/QC refs; registers into `agents/_registry.yaml`; generates the per-agent test skeleton. This is the engine for M7–M9.
- **Workflow A craft agents** (subset, via factory): TrendIntelligenceAgent, CopywriterAgent, SocialMediaStrategistAgent, PromptEngineerAgent/GeneratorOperator, AIQAConsistencyAgent, EditorAgent, AccessibilityOptimizerAgent, AudienceSimAgent, AnalystAgent — exactly the crew in [`ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md`](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §3.1.
- **Workflow A DAG** (`workflows/A_viral_hook.py`): Concept → Production → Post → Review → Distribution → Post-launch, with the spec'd critic gates.
- End-to-end run: brief → DIA → Planner builds the A-DAG → agents execute (mock gen) → artifacts flow with handoff contract → critique bus active → QC mesh gates → C2PA-signed deliverable → events on the bus.

**Claude Code workflow:** Use `/new-agent <n>` per agent. Process category-by-category (camera 6–8, editorial/color 9–18, sound 19–22, performance 23–27, marketing 28–31, domain 32–45, AI-era 46–52). `/clear` between categories. For each agent, `spec-reader` pulls its exact row (self-quality, surpass signal, critique edges) → factory config → test → review.

**Tests:** every agent: L1 schema conformance; L2 rubric ≥85 on its golden inputs; emits/accepts critique per the matrix; respects its tool allowlist; metered. Category-level integration tests (e.g., DoP→Colorist→Editor handoff preserves continuity_state).

**Build:**
- **Psychological Profiling** (100 creator profiles: MBTI, motivations, fears, creative params) → feeds Casting/Talent/Personalization/UGC agents and Aesthetic-Agent *audience-cohort profiles*.
- **Psychological Recommendation** (Big Five / emotional-state preference prediction) → AudienceSim, PerformanceMarketer, Personalization.
- **PersonalizationEngineerAgent** templating (name/face/voice swap) with privacy/consent audit (GDPR/CCPA via ComplianceAgent).
- **Podcast Agent** audio-first workflow (preparation → execution → ending → follow-up), reusing VO/SoundMixer/Editor.

**Steps:**
1. **Read (subagent).** `spec-reader` extracts the six fields above into a structured `AgentBrief`.
2. **Map self-quality → metrics.** Convert "Self-Quality Criteria" into concrete `MetricSpec`s with thresholds (e.g., DoP `rule_of_thirds>=τ, exposure_zone∈[III,VII], color_temp_var<=ΔK`; Colorist `deltaE<2`; SoundMixer `lufs==target, stoi>=0.85`). Many map to existing `packages/qc` validators or the Aesthetics Agent.
3. **Author the L2 rubric/constitution.** Turn "Surpass-Human Signal" + craft sources into a role constitution in `eval/rubrics/<agent>.yaml` (this is what LLM-as-judge scores against). Cite the craft authority named in the spec (Murch's Rule of Six for Editor, 12 principles for Animator, etc.).
4. **Define tools.** Allowlist only the providers/tools this agent may call (e.g., PromptEngineer → MediaGenProvider; Colorist → grade tool; FactChecker → RAG + WebResearch). Enforced by `agent-core`.
5. **Wire critique edges.** From the §4 critique matrix: `critiques_from` and `critiques_on`. ComplianceAgent edges are always blocking.
6. **Write the AgentConfig (YAML)** and register in `agents/_registry.yaml`.
7. **Author the versioned system prompt** (`agents/.../prompt.vN.md`) embedding role, constitution summary, self-refine instruction, and output schema (must emit a valid `Artifact`).
8. **TDD (subagent `test-author`):** golden-input fixtures → assert L1 schema pass, L2 rubric ≥85, correct critique emission/acceptance, tool-allowlist enforcement, metering present, provenance populated.
9. **Implement = instantiate.** `AgentFactory.build(config)` — no new code path; if you find yourself writing bespoke logic, that logic belongs in `agent-core` or a tool, not the agent.
10. **Review (subagent `code-reviewer`)** against DoD + §14 themes; fix; commit `feat(agent-<n>): <Name>`.
11. **Register in workflows** that use it; extend the relevant archetype integration test.

## Migration capability research (v1 honest · 2026-07-13)

Role-specific capability research for **EditorAgent** (`video.editor`, va_id=9, category `3-Edit`).

### Responsibility focus
Assemble cut; pacing; coverage selection

### Prompt research topics (source of truth for S3)
- arXiv topics: 1. Retrieve and integrate state-of-the-art research findings from arXiv papers relevant to: automated video editing, pacing models, color grading AI, EDL generation, music-cut sync
- X topics: 2. Analyze and incorporate expert insights from x.ai (Twitter/X) from recognized industry and academic leaders specializing in: AI video editing, AI color grading, trailer AI tools
- YouTube topics: 3. Extract detailed, actionable technical guidance from high-quality YouTube content created by domain experts focused on: AI editing workflows, auto pacing, AI color grade pipelines

### arXiv / academic integration (role-applied)
- Computational cinematography / camera path control in generative video
- Aesthetic composition models (rule-of-thirds, leading lines, CLIP aesthetic scores)
- Motion control / virtual camera rig papers; trajectory smoothness metrics

**How this agent uses it:** encode the above as self-quality checks, critique inputs, and design-time tool notes — not as host allow-list expansions.

### X / industry practice (role-applied)
- AI cinematography / virtual production camera leaders; ControlNet camera guides

### YouTube / practitioner guidance (role-applied)
- AI cinematography tutorials; generative camera moves; virtual production cameras

### Implementation notes for v1
1. Emit artifacts matching role responsibility; self-score against Self-quality criteria.
2. Accept critique only from listed critics; escalate disputes to Judge/Gate as DNA dictates.
3. Design-time tools remain documented only; runtime tools stay in `agent_spec.json`.
4. N1: no second control plane; video logic under `business/video/**` only.

### Research depth note (honest)
This v1 section maps **role-family** literature and the agent’s migration prompt topics into SPEC.
It is **not** a full unsummarized download of every paper/video transcript.
Live primary-source expansion remains a residual for score 100 on S3 where depth is still thin.
