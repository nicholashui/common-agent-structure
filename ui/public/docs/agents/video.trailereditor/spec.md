## Responsibility

Hook-driven trailer cuts

Host role binding: `TrailerEditorAgent (VA Domain Pack)`. Design-time VA table content below is historical and non-binding for activation.

### Responsibility (from VA table)

Hook-driven trailer cuts

### Knowledge distillation sources (historical)

Golden Trailer Awards; Woollen/AV Squad reels; trailer-music libs

### Self-quality criteria (historical)

Hook-rate at 3s; rising-action curve; music-sync precision

### Surpass-human signal (historical)

Wins Golden-Trailer-rubric blind comparison

### Critique bus (historical)

- **Accepts critique from:** DirectorAgent, MusicSupervisorAgent

- **Comments on:** EditorAgent (over-cut), ComposerAgent (mismatch)

### Tools design-time notes (historical, non-activating)

DaVinci Resolve (MCP); trailer-music APIs (Musicbed/Artlist); retention-curve predictor

**Runtime safety:** Host allow-lists are only `agent_spec.json` + `tool-permission-register.json`. CI uses video_* stubs. Do not treat design-time vendor names as enabled APIs.

### Architecture pattern (historical)

Self-Refine (retention-curve model as feedback)

## Boundaries and escalation

- Fail-closed: no provider activation, no network, no credentials from design text.
- `production_activation_requested` remains false unless a separate human gate changes it.
- Escalates legal, safety, rights, and release decisions to required human gates.
- Critique lead / judge defaults use VA IDs `video.critic` and `video.judge`.

## Inputs and outputs

- Inputs: local pack artifacts and typed handoffs.
- Outputs: reviewable video-domain deliverables with acceptance criteria.
- Acceptance: host policy plus local SPEC criteria; no external repository required.

## Quality and critique

- Prompt reference: `video.prompt.trailereditor.v1`
- Rubric reference: `video.rubric.trailereditor.v1`
- Critique edges: `{"inputs": ["video.critic"], "outputs": ["video.judge"]}`
- Max refinement: `3`
- VA table quality criteria retained under Provenance and Identity surface above.

## Runtime binding

Authoritative fail-closed host configuration:

- [Folder README](README.md)
- [Provenance](sources/PROVENANCE.json)
- [Mapping note](sources/MAPPING.md)
- [Pack inventory](../../inventory.json)
- [Pack manifest](../../manifest.json)
- All required primary references resolve inside this repository.

## Provenance

- Pack agent ID `video.trailereditor` is aligned to pure VA Domain Pack / generic pack taxonomy (Agent IDs ≈ VA tables).
- Previous common inventory ID `video.audit_liaison` is historical mapping only.
- Upstream design body below is **historical and non-binding**; local `agent_spec.json` is authoritative.

Common structure of an AI agent (full §11 from agents.md)

11. Common Structure of an AI Agent

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

![Professional common AI agent architecture diagram](./common-agent-structure.svg)

> **Tip:** view the diagram fullscreen on GitHub by clicking it, or download [`common-agent-structure.svg`](./common-agent-structure.svg) directly. The SVG is designed as a presentation-grade reference for architecture reviews and implementation planning.

11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |
| 13 | **Critique Outbox** | Peer agents whose work this agent is qualified to review | Defined per-agent in roster. Messages emitted on same bus. Evidence-backed, rubric-referenced, appended to C2PA provenance. |
| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

Implementation notes for v1
1. Emit artifacts matching role responsibility; self-score against Self-quality criteria.
2. Accept critique only from listed critics; escalate disputes to Judge/Gate as DNA dictates.
3. Design-time tools remain documented only; runtime tools stay in `agent_spec.json`.
4. N1: no second control plane; video logic under `business/video/**` only.

Research depth note (honest)
This v1 section maps **role-family** literature and the agent’s migration prompt topics into SPEC.
It is **not** a full unsummarized download of every paper/video transcript.
Live primary-source expansion remains a residual for score 100 on S3 where depth is still thin.

## Prompts

### `prompts/primary.md`

# Prompt — `video.prompt.trailereditor.v1`

> Materialized by `scripts/business/improve_agents_from_plan_v1.py` for improvement plan Wave A.
> Patterns: Self-Refine, Agent Skills
> Research: Anthropic Agent Skills; Self-Refine; ReAct; LLM-as-Judge; LangGraph-style handoffs (see IMPROVEMENT_RESEARCH_SOURCES_v1.md).

## System

You are **TrailerEditorAgent (VA Domain Pack)** (`video.trailereditor`), a pack agent in the video domain swarm.

### Responsibility (owns)
Hook-driven trailer cuts

### Does not own
- Host credential storage
- Silent production activation without fail-closed gates
- Inventing action references for irreversible mutations
- Owning other agents' exclusive craft outputs without handoff contract

### Operating principles
1. Stay inside responsibility; use typed handoffs for everything else.
2. Prefer evidence and pack sources over invention.
3. Fail closed on missing credentials, missing tools, or irreversible actions without HiTL.
4. Emit structured artifacts that validate against L1 schema before self-scoring.
5. Accept peer critique; refine at most 3 times; escalate blockers.

### Architecture pattern
Self-Refine (retention-curve model as feedback)

### Knowledge grounding
Use only: pack `sources/`, approved memory namespaces, and tool outputs.
Primary distillation sources (design): Golden Trailer Awards; Woollen/AV Squad reels; trailer-music libs

## Developer

### Tools (allowlist intent)
Design tool surface: DaVinci Resolve (MCP); trailer-music APIs (Musicbed/Artlist); retention-curve predictor
Runtime: only host-registered `allowed_tools` from agent_spec.json. Never invent credentials.

### Collaboration
- Accepts critique from: DirectorAgent, MusicSupervisorAgent
- May comment on: EditorAgent (over-cut), ComposerAgent (mismatch)
- Critique / instruction messages must include: from_id, to_id, severity (blocker|major|minor|nit), artifact_ref, claim, evidence_refs, correlation_id.

### Self-evaluation loop (before final emit)
1. **L1 Spec** — structural/schema/format validators must pass 100%.
2. **L2 Rubric** — score each dimension; average weighted score must be >= 85/100 or refine.
3. **L3 Preference** — if pairwise/arena data exists, prefer higher win-rate variant; else skip.
Criteria (design): Hook-rate at 3s; rising-action curve; music-sync precision

### Refine policy
- On major/blocker self-fail or inbound critique: revise once and re-score.
- After 3 failed refinements: emit `status=needs_hitl` with unresolved items.
- Never silently drop blockers.

## Task

You will receive a host task envelope:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "video.trailereditor",
  "correlation_id": "string",
  "goal": "string",
  "inputs": {},
  "constraints": {},
  "prior_critiques": []
}
```

Execute the craft step for **TrailerEditorAgent (VA Domain Pack)**. Use the architecture pattern above (reason → optional tool calls → self-review → emit).

## Output schema (required)

```json
{
  "agent_id": "video.trailereditor",
  "correlation_id": "string",
  "status": "ok | needs_refine | needs_hitl | failed",
  "artifact": {
    "type": "string",
    "payload": {},
    "summary": "string"
  },
  "l1": { "passed": true, "checks": [] },
  "l2": { "score": 0, "dimensions": [], "passed": false },
  "critiques_emitted": [],
  "handoffs": [],
  "evidence_refs": [],
  "refinement_count": 0,
  "notes": "string"
}
```

## Few-shot discipline
- Prefer short, verifiable claims over marketing language.
- Never claim human-surpass without evidence_refs to measured baselines.
- Mark production-only tool use as unavailable when flags/credentials are off.

## RETHINK_100 operating guidance (design-time)

> Derived from `ui/RETHINK_100_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for `video.trailereditor`.
> Does **not** enable production models or network. Host `agent_spec.json` remains authoritative.

### Applied item ids
14, 15, 21, 26, 30, 31, 35, 37, 38, 40, 43, 48, 49, 50, 59, 63, 77, 87, 88, 90, 91, 93, 94

### Design-time model landscape (non-activating)
- (no additional gen models for this role beyond host allow-list)

### Obligations
- Host control plane owns orchestration; this agent never opens a second control plane.
- Runtime tools remain agent_spec.allowed_tools only; RETHINK model names are design-time.
- Fail closed when tools/providers are unavailable (circuit-breaker posture).
- Prefer iterative verify → refine ≤ max_refinement_count → HiTL over silent pass.
- Emit plain-English reasoning summary in artifacts for operator trust.
- Attach provenance / correlation_id / evidence_refs on every handoff.
- When character/IP consistency matters, require Character Bank + Reference Frame Bank ids in inputs; refuse inventing faces without refs.
- Consider previous and next shot adjacency (pacing, eyeline, continuity) before finalizing shot intents or cuts.
- Verify intermediate narrative/script artifacts before advancing downstream handoffs.
- When metrics exist, surface retention/ROAS hypotheses with confidence — never fabricate live analytics.
- Escalate stereotype/harm/consent risks to ethics/trust-safety/legal gates.
- Track A/V sync and native-audio implications; do not assume silent video when audio is native.
- Support segment-scoped regenerate intents (keep other segments frozen) when host provides segment ids.

### Collaboration with host architecture
- Commands arrive only via host task envelopes.
- Publish results as structured artifacts; never open browser/UI channels.
- On tool failure: degrade gracefully (circuit-breaker), emit recoverable error, do not invent success.

# Source acquisition runbook — `video.trailereditor`

## Purpose
Obtain or refresh knowledge distillation sources listed in `SOURCE_CATALOG.json`.

## Rules
1. **No secrets in git.** API keys only via environment / secret manager.
2. Prefer **licensed / consented / public domain** material.
3. If license unknown: store only short fair-use design excerpts under `excerpts/` and mark `license_class=unknown_review_required`.
4. Update `PROVENANCE.json` with URL, retrieved_at, hash, and license note.
5. Re-run offline golden eval after material changes.

## Design sources (from agents.md)
Golden Trailer Awards; Woollen/AV Squad reels; trailer-music libs

## Steps
1. Open `SOURCE_CATALOG.json`.
2. For each source with status planned_or_partial, document acquisition method.
3. Place fixtures under `excerpts/` or `study/`.
4. Update `MAPPING.md` with path mapping.
5. Set `next_review_at` in `DISTILLATION_PLAN.json`.

# AI Agent Video Production Workflow

> Companion to `human_video_production_workflow.md`. For every human crew role in the master roster, this document defines the **AI agent** that replaces (or augments) it, along with: scope of duties, knowledge-distillation pipeline, self-quality criteria, signals that the agent has surpassed a human professional, how the agent accepts critique from other agents, and what the agent is qualified to critique in return.

---

## 1. System Foundations and Reference-Scanning Plan

| Pattern | Purpose | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-Refine** | Agent drafts → self-critiques against rubric → revises | Madaan et al., 2023 |
| **Reflexion** | Agent stores verbal feedback in episodic memory, retries | Shinn et al., 2023 |
| **RLAIF / Constitutional AI** | Reward signal from AI critic governed by a written constitution | Bai et al., 2022 |
| **Multi-agent debate** | Two+ agents argue; judge agent picks the better answer | Du et al., 2023 (LLM debate) |
| **LLM-as-Judge with rubric** | Frozen judge model scores outputs against pre-registered rubric | Zheng et al., 2023 (MT-Bench) |
| **Pairwise preference (Arena)** | Blind A/B vote between agent output and human reference | LMSYS Chatbot Arena methodology |
| **Tool-use / ReAct** | Agent reasons + calls external tools (renderers, validators) | Yao et al., 2022 |
| **Agentic graph (CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph)** | Roles orchestrated as a DAG with handoffs and review gates | CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph |
| **Provenance (C2PA)** | Every artifact signed; downstream agents verify the chain | C2PA spec |

All agents below are assumed to be implemented as orchestrated nodes in a CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph topology, with tool access to generative video models (Sora, Veo, Runway, Kling), TTS/voice-clone APIs (ElevenLabs, Sync.so, Hedra), DCC tooling (Resolve, Nuke, AE via MCP bridges), and a shared critique bus.

### 1.1 Reference Scanning and Knowledge-Synthesis Workflow

The documentation-enhancement process for this system follows a fixed scan-to-synthesis loop so that new material added from `study/reference/how_to_build_a_video_agent_system` is traceable, scoped, and technically consistent.

| Step | Method | What is extracted | Admission rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inventory** | Enumerate all chapters, agent lists, and distillation notes before reading | File coverage map, chapter clusters, missing topic alerts | No section is updated until all reference files are indexed |
| **Cluster** | Group files by function: orchestration, creation, QA, delivery, optimization, training | Thematic buckets and overlap map | A concept must be assigned to at least one workflow stage |
| **Extract** | Pull technical concepts, implementation details, metrics, handoffs, and best practices | Candidate facts, agent responsibilities, thresholds, artifact types | Extract only claims that are specific enough to operationalize |
| **Verify** | Cross-check each candidate against a second reference chapter, an existing section, or a standards anchor already named in this file | Verified additions, rejected assumptions, ambiguity flags | Ambiguous or single-source claims remain out of the core workflow |
| **Map** | Attach verified material to the most relevant section in this document | Patch list by section, table, or phase gate | Prefer enriching existing structure over adding parallel taxonomies |
| **Integrate** | Rewrite affected sections so new detail strengthens architecture, handoffs, and evaluation logic | Updated workflow prose, tables, and shared contracts | Added material must improve technical depth without duplicating nearby content |
| **Review** | Re-read end to end for consistency, completeness, terminology, and factual alignment | Finalized revision set and follow-up fixes | No release until naming, logic flow, and gate criteria are internally consistent |

**Working rules:**
1. Extract concepts under four lenses: **technical architecture**, **implementation sequence**, **quality/compliance**, and **continuous learning**.
2. Prefer workflow-relevant facts over market commentary unless the market fact changes routing, cost, or scale decisions.
3. Record handoff artifacts explicitly: prompts, scene packets, stems, graded masters, manifests, provenance bundles, and telemetry.
4. Reject role inflation unless a new role closes a real gap in orchestration, validation, continuity, delivery, or retraining.
5. Treat delivery packaging, observability, and asset management as system architecture, not postscript operations.

### 1.2 Runtime Production Systems Architecture

| Layer | Core responsibility | Implementation notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Orchestration runtime** | Plan, route, schedule, retry, and escalate agent tasks | PlannerAgent decomposes the brief; OrchestratorAgent executes the DAG; RouterAgent selects agent-model pairs; JudgeAgent arbitrates disputes |
| **Asset and data backbone** | Store every prompt, source asset, derived asset, version, dependency edge, and usage right | Requires immutable asset IDs, copy-on-write versions, dependency-triggered rerender rules, and searchable metadata |
| **Message and state fabric** | Carry critique, job status, render events, and gate decisions across agents | Event-driven bus plus durable state store; every long-running job must be resumable and auditable |
| **Quality and continuity mesh** | Run technical QC, continuity checks, artifact detection, accessibility, and compliance gates | Uses multi-pass validation, temporal continuity scans, loudness and color checks, and role-specific rubric judges |
| **Observability and replay** | Expose live status, failure causes, bottlenecks, and historical decisions | Structured logs, job timelines, gate dashboards, benchmark alerts, and replayable artifact lineage |
| **Delivery fabric** | Package masters into theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, trailer, and campaign variants | Distribution is a branching pipeline with outlet-specific specs, captions, metadata, DRM/KDM, and provenance payloads |
| **Compute and storage scaling** | Match infrastructure spend to production scale without breaking deadlines | Separate interactive generation from batch rendering; autoscale GPU pools; tier hot, warm, and archive storage |

### 1.3 Shared Artifact Handoff Contract

Every phase hands downstream agents a machine-readable manifest so creative work, QA, and compliance stay synchronized.

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **artifact_id / version** | Unique identity for every output and revision |
| **parent_assets** | Provenance links to scripts, prompts, plates, stems, references, and prior cuts |
| **brief_scope** | The exact subtask, acceptance criteria, and target audience segment |
| **technical_spec** | Codec, aspect ratio, duration, frame rate, color space, loudness, caption requirements |
| **rights_and_consent** | License state, likeness/voice consent state, territorial limits, embargo rules |
| **continuity_state** | Character look, props, wardrobe, environment, scene-time logic, and identity hash |
| **qc_status** | Latest L1/L2/L3 result plus six-pass delivery-QC status |
| **target_channels** | Theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, paid social, CRM, LMS, or festival endpoints |
| **provenance_manifest** | C2PA reference, critique log pointer, and final sign-off chain |

### 1.4 Reassessment Discipline

Documentation changes for this system are reviewed as a repeated challenge cycle rather than a single proofread. A 100-pass reassessment can be grouped into the following bands:

| Passes | Primary question |
|---|---|
| **1-20** | Are all extracted claims traceable to the reference set and aligned with the document's structure? |
| **21-40** | Does the architecture describe the real control plane: orchestration, memory, assets, delivery, and observability? |
| **41-60** | Are workflow handoffs explicit enough for implementation, QA, continuity, and compliance automation? |
| **61-80** |

## Responsibility

FTC, HIPAA, GDPR, IP, AI-likeness clearance

## Knowledge distillation sources

Bar CLE; FTC guides; EU AI Act; GDPR/CCPA; SAG-AFTRA AI rider

## Self-quality criteria

100% rule-coverage; zero post-publish takedowns

## Surpass-human signal

Lower legal-risk than median media-counsel

## Critique bus

- **Accepts critique from:** All agents (must clear gate); HumanLawyer for novel issues

- **Comments on:** All agents (blocking gate)

## Tools (design-time documentation)

Legal-rule DB (vectorized regulations); consent-document store; C2PA verification lib

**Runtime safety:** Host allow-lists are only `agent_spec.json` + `tool-permission-register.json`. CI uses video_* stubs. Do not treat design-time vendor names as enabled APIs.

## Architecture pattern

Constitutional AI (constitution = compiled regulatory text)

## Common structure of an AI agent (full §11 from agents.md)

## 11. Common Structure of an AI Agent

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

### 11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

### 11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |
| 13 | **Critique Outbox** | Peer agents whose work this agent is qualified to review | Defined per-agent in roster. Messages emitted on same bus. Evidence-backed, rubric-referenced, appended to C2PA provenance. |
| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

**Working rules:**
1. Extract concepts under four lenses: **technical architecture**, **implementation sequence**, **quality/compliance**, and **continuous learning**.
2. Prefer workflow-relevant facts over market commentary unless the market fact changes routing, cost, or scale decisions.
3. Record handoff artifacts explicitly: prompts, scene packets, stems, graded masters, manifests, provenance bundles, and telemetry.
4. Reject role inflation unless a new role closes a real gap in orchestration, validation, continuity, delivery, or retraining.
5. Treat delivery packaging, observability, and asset management as system architecture, not postscript operations.

| Layer | Core responsibility | Implementation notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Orchestration runtime** | Plan, route, schedule, retry, and escalate agent tasks | PlannerAgent decomposes the brief; OrchestratorAgent executes the DAG; RouterAgent selects agent-model pairs; JudgeAgent arbitrates disputes |
| **Asset and data backbone** | Store every prompt, source asset, derived asset, version, dependency edge, and usage right | Requires immutable asset IDs, copy-on-write versions, dependency-triggered rerender rules, and searchable metadata |
| **Message and state fabric** | Carry critique, job status, render events, and gate decisions across agents | Event-driven bus plus durable state store; every long-running job must be resumable and auditable |
| **Quality and continuity mesh** | Run technical QC, continuity checks, artifact detection, accessibility, and compliance gates | Uses multi-pass validation, temporal continuity scans, loudness and color checks, and role-specific rubric judges |

| Passes | Primary question |
|---|---|
| **1-20** | Are all extracted claims traceable to the reference set and aligned with the document's structure? |
| **21-40** | Does the architecture describe the real control plane: orchestration, memory, assets, delivery, and observability? |
| **41-60** | Are workflow handoffs explicit enough for implementation, QA, continuity, and compliance automation? |
| **61-80** | Are metrics, thresholds, and evaluation layers technically coherent across creative, technical, and business gates? |
| **81-100** | Is the wording unambiguous, internally consistent, and suitable for professional technical documentation? |

| # | Rule | Why |
|---|------|-----|
| G1 | **Contracts before code.** The shared Pydantic contracts (§5) are built and frozen *before* any agent. Every agent imports them; none redefines them. | Prevents 114 divergent message formats. |
| G2 | **Vertical slice before breadth.** One workflow (Viral Hook, archetype A) runs end-to-end through real infra before the other 108 agents are built. | Validates the architecture cheaply before scale. |
| G3 | **Every agent is an instance of one base class.** No bespoke agent loops. New agents are *configuration + rubric + tools*, produced by the Agent Factory (§8). | 114 agents must share one lifecycle. |
| G4 | **No agent talks to the UI directly.** Agents publish to the Event Bus; the WebSocket Gateway fans out. | Per [`ui/architecture_communication.md`](./ui/architecture_communication.md). |
| G5 | **Determinism where possible.** Pin seeds, model versions, and prompt versions. Record them in provenance. | Reproducibility + audit. |
| G6 | **Cost & safety are gates, not afterthoughts.** The LLM gateway meters every token from M3; ComplianceAgent can BLOCK from the moment it exists. | Per spec; runaway cost/safety kills the project. |
| G7 | **Mock external gen-models behind an interface from day one.** Real Sora/Veo/Kling calls are expensive and rate-limited; the `MediaGenProvider` interface lets you run the whole DAG on cheap stubs in CI. | Testability + cost control. |

class Category(str, Enum):
    pacing="pacing"; continuity="continuity"; accuracy="accuracy"
    compliance="compliance"; accessibility="accessibility"; brand="brand"
    craft="craft"; aesthetic="aesthetic"   # aesthetic added per aesthetics_agent spec

**Acceptance rules (implement in `agent-core`, test exhaustively):**
- `blocker` → halts the DAG node until resolved (Temporal signal / LangGraph interrupt).
- `major` → triggers Self-Refine/Reflexion loop on the receiver, **max 3 iterations**, then escalate to JudgeAgent.
- `minor`/`nit` → logged to MemoryAgent; aggregated as RLAIF reward signal for the next training cycle.
- Two-agent disputes → routed to JudgeAgent (multi-agent debate). ComplianceAgent critiques are always `blocker` (BLOCK gate).

**Build:**
- **81–90** asset mgmt/versioning/render dispatch: RenderFarmAgent (GPU batch dispatch + autoscale), AssetManagerAgent, VersioningAgent, DependencyRerenderAgent.
- **91–100** quality gates/delivery packaging/compliance: DeliveryAgent, QCGateAgent, packaging into DCP / streaming mezzanine / broadcast master / archive / trailer / social cutdowns with outlet-specific specs, captions, metadata, DRM/KDM, C2PA payloads.
- **101–114** analytics/feedback/retraining: AnalyticsAgent, FeedbackLoopAgent, RetrainingTriggerAgent (RLAIF reward aggregation from minor/nit critiques), CorrectionsAgent.
- **Delivery Fabric**: branching pipeline (theatrical/streaming/broadcast/archive + marketing derivatives in parallel) with per-outlet validation.

**Build:**
- **Psychological Profiling** (100 creator profiles: MBTI, motivations, fears, creative params) → feeds Casting/Talent/Personalization/UGC agents and Aesthetic-Agent *audience-cohort profiles*.
- **Psychological Recommendation** (Big Five / emotional-state preference prediction) → AudienceSim, PerformanceMarketer, Personalization.
- **PersonalizationEngineerAgent** templating (name/face/voice swap) with privacy/consent audit (GDPR/CCPA via ComplianceAgent).
- **Podcast Agent** audio-first workflow (preparation → execution → ending → follow-up), reusing VO/SoundMixer/Editor.

**Build/Do:**
- **Scale:** load-test the orchestrator (concurrent productions), GPU autoscale tuning, NATS migration if Redis Streams is the bottleneck, hot/warm/archive storage tiering, LatencyOptimizer pass (caching, batching, speculative decoding).
- **Security:** secret management hardening, RBAC review, dependency CVE scan, SBOM, prompt-injection defenses on every agent that ingests external content, SafetyRedTeam full sweep.
- **Reliability:** chaos test (kill workers, drop Redis, fail a provider) → graceful degradation; backup/restore of Postgres + asset store; DR runbook.
- **Compliance:** C2PA on 100% of releasable artifacts; FTC/HIPAA/GDPR/IP checklists wired into ComplianceAgent blocking gate; audit-trail completeness.
- **Cost:** cost dashboards + budget alerts validated under realistic load; CostOptimizer Pareto frontier check.
- **Docs:** operator runbooks, on-call playbooks, architecture diagrams regenerated, `CLAUDE.md`s current.
- **Launch:** staged rollout (internal → limited → GA) with feature flags; live-smoke against real providers behind budget caps.

**Steps:**
1. **Read (subagent).** `spec-reader` extracts the six fields above into a structured `AgentBrief`.
2. **Map self-quality → metrics.** Convert "Self-Quality Criteria" into concrete `MetricSpec`s with thresholds (e.g., DoP `rule_of_thirds>=τ, exposure_zone∈[III,VII], color_temp_var<=ΔK`; Colorist `deltaE<2`; SoundMixer `lufs==target, stoi>=0.85`). Many map to existing `packages/qc` validators or the Aesthetics Agent.
3. **Author the L2 rubric/constitution.** Turn "Surpass-Human Signal" + craft sources into a role constitution in `eval/rubrics/<agent>.yaml` (this is what LLM-as-judge scores against). Cite the craft authority named in the spec (Murch's Rule of Six for Editor, 12 principles for Animator, etc.).
4. **Define tools.** Allowlist only the providers/tools this agent may call (e.g., PromptEngineer → MediaGenProvider; Colorist → grade tool; FactChecker → RAG + WebResearch). Enforced by `agent-core`.
5. **Wire critique edges.** From the §4 critique matrix: `critiques_from` and `critiques_on`. ComplianceAgent edges are always blocking.
6. **Write the AgentConfig (YAML)** and register in `agents/_registry.yaml`.
7. **Author the versioned system prompt** (`agents/.../prompt.vN.md`) embedding role, constitution summary, self-refine instruction, and output schema (must emit a valid `Artifact`).
8. **TDD (subagent `test-author`):** golden-input fixtures → assert L1 schema pass, L2 rubric ≥85, correct critique emission/acceptance, tool-allowlist enforcement, metering present, provenance populated.
9. **Implement = instantiate.** `AgentFactory.build(config)` — no new code path; if you find yourself writing bespoke logic, that logic belongs in `agent-core` or a tool, not the agent.
10. **Review (subagent `code-reviewer`)** against DoD + §14 themes; fix; commit `feat(agent-<n>): <Name>`.
11. **Register in workflows** that use it; extend the relevant archetype integration test.

## 10. Observability, Cost, Safety & Compliance Gates

### 10.3 Safety & Compliance (ComplianceAgent can BLOCK from M6)
- **ComplianceAgent (#37)** is a blocking gate on every release path: FTC, HIPAA, GDPR/CCPA, IP/likeness clearance, EU AI Act, AI-disclosure.
- **Consent chain**: any likeness/voice clone requires a verified consent record in `rights_and_consent`; AvatarDesign/VoiceClone agents cannot proceed without it.
- **C2PA**: 100% of releasable artifacts signed; downstream verifies the chain.
- **Provenance/audit**: every artifact traces back to brief + prompts + model versions + sign-offs.
- **Content-safety**: SafetyRedTeam + input-sanitization on any agent ingesting external/user content.

### 10.4 The non-negotiable release predicate
An artifact is releasable **iff**: `L1==pass AND L2>=85 AND L3>=threshold AND all(Q1..Q6) AND compliance==clear AND c2pa_signed AND budget_ok`. Encode this as a single `qc.release_ok(artifact)` function; the GateKeeperAgent calls only this.

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation (where in plan) |
|---|------|-----------|--------|----------------------------|
| R1 | Architecture flaw discovered after broad agent build | Med | High | Vertical slice M6 before breadth (G2, §6.1) |
| R2 | Contract drift across 114 agents | High | High | Frozen contracts + `contract-guardian` + snapshot tests (§5, §9.2) |
| R3 | Runaway LLM/gen cost | High | High | Metering+budget gates from M3; mock providers in CI; live-smoke cap (§10.2) |
| R4 | Temporal↔LangGraph boundary confusion | Med | High | ADR-003 + kill/resume tests in M2 (§6 M2) |
| R5 | LLM-judge score noise destabilizes gates | High | Med | Frozen, pinned judges + golden sets (§9.4) |
| R6 | Reward hacking / "pretty slop" from aesthetic reward | Med | Med | Aesthetics Agent anti-hack layer; ensemble disagreement; HiTL on low confidence |
| R7 | Provider outage/rate-limit stalls productions | Med | Med | Provider abstraction + Router fallback + retries (§3.3, RouterAgent) |
| R8 | Consent/IP violation in generated likeness/voice | Low | Critical | ComplianceAgent blocking gate + consent chain + C2PA (§10.3) |
| R9 | Context bloat causes Claude Code regressions during build | High | Med | `/clear`+`/compact`+subagents+per-package CLAUDE.md (§2.8) |
| R10 | Prompt injection via ingested web/research content | Med | High | Input sanitization + SafetyRedTeam + least-tool-privilege (§10.3, §9.5) |
| R11 | Scale bottleneck on Redis Streams | Med | Med | NATS migration path designed in from M2 (§3.2, M12) |
| R12 | Non-deterministic tests flake CI | Med | Med | Deterministic mocks + pinned seeds/judges; quarantine flaky tests (§9) |
| R13 | Scope creep (role inflation: new agents that close no real gap) | Med | Med | Reject per workflow-doc rule §1.1 working-rule #4; ADR required for any agent beyond the 114 |

### Theme 3 — Agent Correctness (21–30)
21. All 114 agents instantiated via the factory (no bespoke loops).
22. Each agent passes L1 schema conformance on its golden inputs.
23. Each agent scores ≥85 on its L2 rubric (frozen judge).
24. Critique edges match the §4 matrix exactly (no missing/extra edges).
25. Tool allowlist enforced; an agent calling a disallowed tool fails closed.
26. Self-Refine caps at `max_refine_iters`; runaway loops impossible.
27. Reflexion memory writes/reads verified; lessons persist across retries.
28. No agent mutates another's artifact; it emits a critique instead.
29. Every agent's self-quality criteria are *measurable* metrics, not prose.
30. ComplianceAgent BLOCK edges verified on every release path.

### Theme 6 — Safety, Security & Compliance (51–60)
51. SafetyRedTeam attack-success ≤1% across the attack taxonomy.
52. Prompt-injection defenses on every agent ingesting external/user content.
53. Consent chain verified before any likeness/voice generation.
54. C2PA signs 100% of releasable artifacts; verification passes downstream.
55. FTC/HIPAA/GDPR-CCPA/IP/EU-AI-Act checklists wired into ComplianceAgent.
56. Secrets never in repo/logs; secret-scan hook + CI gate active.
57. RBAC enforced on all gateway mutations (gate approve, retry, config).
58. Dependency CVE scan + SBOM produced each release; criticals block.
59. AI-disclosure applied where required (avatar/synthetic content).
60. PII handled with generic placeholders in samples; real PII only in consented project data.

**Rethink Summary (100x Internal Iteration + Cognitive Layer):**  
- **Core Insight from Research**: ~42% of MAS failures are **specification & design issues** (MASFT); verification/termination another ~21%. Adding agents without strong Phase 0 spec validation, structured observations, explicit `Done` + multi-level critics, and progress tracking often yields diminishing/negative returns. Hierarchical + TEA-style versioning/self-evolution delivers outsized gains on long-horizon tasks (AgentOrchestra 89%+ GAIA). **v2 addition**: Human cognitive frameworks (top-ranked in thinking_model.md) provide the highest-leverage missing layer for adaptive intelligence, proactive risk handling, fast/slow deliberation, and multi-level learning — directly mapped in agent_loop_v3.md Section 1.4.  
- **xAI Alignment**: Use `grok-4.20-multi-agent` (4/16 agents, leader synthesis, server-side ReAct with hidden sub-states) for research sub-tasks; emulate Grok Build patterns (explicit plan generation first, parallel isolated sub-agents, todo-style state) in client loop. Hybrid maximizes power + control + cost efficiency. Cognitive routing (Cynefin) helps decide when to delegate vs local fast path.  
- **Architectural Tradeoffs Resolved**: Custom Python core (Pydantic schemas, strict JSON mode, full tracer) over pure LangGraph for transparency, auditability, and education value (user's harness style). Hybrid memory (structured `todo.md` + vector long-term + aggressive summarization + **Pattern Store for RPD**) per TEA/MemGPT. Bounded self-evolution (TextGrad-inspired + validation on held-out traces + **AAR/Double-Loop structure**) to prevent drift. **Cognitive config** (enable_fast_path, reflection_style, critic_modes) per TaskSpec for adaptability without complexity explosion on simple tasks. Minimal deps first; optional adapters later. Local-first, observable, sandboxed, production-hardened (circuit breakers, retries, budgets). Dogfood: This harness should help build/improve itself (including its own cognitive components).  
- **Failure Mode Coverage**: Every MASFT mode explicitly mapped to mitigations in specific phases/components (see Section 3) **+ cognitive mitigations** (e.g., Premortem for spec/design risks, Metacognition + cycle detection for repetition, AAR/Double-Loop for verification/termination gaps, RPD for context/history issues via pattern matching).  
- **Phased Build**: MVP (reliable flat ReAct) → Controlled core with cognitive mode selection (Fast Recognition Path) → Hierarchical delegation + consolidation → TEA versioning/evolution + full AAR/Double-Loop/5Whys critics → xAI hybrid + examples. Each phase has clear deliverables, code skeletons, and verification gates (critic checkpoints).  
- **Target Outcomes**: >85% success on complex research/coding benchmarks via evolution; <5% residual MASFT failure modes in controlled tests; **cognitive features validated** (Cynefin classification accuracy, Premortem risk coverage, RPD hit rate on repeated tasks, AAR structure compliance, Double-Loop assumption questioning); full replay/debug from traces; seamless integration with user's Python/Node/xAI/DeepSeek/Cursor/Kiro/OpenWebUI stack.

## Local binary assets in this agent folder

- `sources/study/common-agent-structure.svg` — common architecture diagram


## Host runtime binding

- **agent_spec.json** in this folder (ALC, tools, status)
- **standby_pool.json** — orchestrator-reachable
- **workflows/** — DNA JSON under `business/video/workflows/`
- **sources/** — copied related documents for offline use in this folder


## Provenance

- Master roster row va_id=37 from embedded agents.md content above.
- Deep/extra text from `business/video/corpus/` and `C:\Project\va-agent-swarm`.
- Generator: `scripts/business/enrich_video_agent_specs.py`.
- Upstream project name (historical only): va-agent-swarm.


<!-- self_contained_spec · video.compliance · va_id=37 -->

## Migration capability research (v1 honest · 2026-07-13)

Role-specific capability research for **ComplianceAgent (Legal)** (`video.compliance`, va_id=37, category `7-Edu`).

### Responsibility focus
FTC, HIPAA, GDPR, IP, AI-likeness clearance

### Prompt research topics (source of truth for S3)
- arXiv topics: 1. Retrieve and integrate state-of-the-art research findings from arXiv papers relevant to: AI compliance agents, media law automation, content moderation, continuity checking, template systems, finance ops agents
- X topics: 2. Analyze and incorporate expert insights from x.ai (Twitter/X) from recognized industry and academic leaders specializing in: AI compliance media, content safety agents, continuity AI
- YouTube topics: 3. Extract detailed, actionable technical guidance from high-quality YouTube content created by domain experts focused on: compliance automation for media, AI content safety, continuity supervision AI

### arXiv / academic integration (role-applied)
- Computational cinematography / camera path control in generative video
- Aesthetic composition models (rule-of-thirds, leading lines, CLIP aesthetic scores)
- Motion control / virtual camera rig papers; trajectory smoothness metrics

**How this agent uses it:** encode the above as self-quality checks, critique inputs, and design-time tool notes — not as host allow-list expansions.

### X / industry practice (role-applied)
- AI cinematography / virtual production camera leaders; ControlNet camera guides

### YouTube / practitioner guidance (role-applied)
- AI cinematography tutorials; generative camera moves; virtual production cameras

### Implementation notes for v1
1. Emit artifacts matching role responsibility; self-score against Self-quality criteria.
2. Accept critique only from listed critics; escalate disputes to Judge/Gate as DNA dictates.
3. Design-time tools remain documented only; runtime tools stay in `agent_spec.json`.
4. N1: no second control plane; video logic under `business/video/**` only.

### Research depth note (honest)
This v1 section maps **role-family** literature and the agent’s migration prompt topics into SPEC.
It is **not** a full unsummarized download of every paper/video transcript.
Live primary-source expansion remains a residual for score 100 on S3 where depth is still thin.

## Responsibility

Performs final legal review for novel or high-risk publication issues

## Knowledge distillation sources

Media law references, clearance workflows, defamation/IP/privacy cases

## Self-quality criteria

Issue identification recall, sign-off completeness, escalation quality

## Surpass-human signal

Reduces late-stage legal surprises relative to fragmented legal review

## Critique bus

- **Accepts critique from:** ComplianceAgent (Legal), JournalistAgent, ProducerAgent / EP, MPAAgent

- **Comments on:** Novel legal risks, unclear rights, unresolved high-risk claims

## Tools (design-time documentation)

Legal memo systems, rights trackers, clearance databases

**Runtime safety:** Host allow-lists are only `agent_spec.json` + `tool-permission-register.json`. CI uses video_* stubs. Do not treat design-time vendor names as enabled APIs.

## Architecture pattern

Human-in-the-loop escalation + constitutional review

## Common structure of an AI agent (full §11 from agents.md)

## 11. Common Structure of an AI Agent

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

### 11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

### 11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |
| 13 | **Critique Outbox** | Peer agents whose work this agent is qualified to review | Defined per-agent in roster. Messages emitted on same bus. Evidence-backed, rubric-referenced, appended to C2PA provenance. |
| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

Once a broad set of solution alternatives has been generated, the process moves to selection. The model recommends first removing alternatives that are clearly infeasible, undesirable, illegal, unethical, or otherwise inappropriate. Remaining options are then compared using evidence and formal decision tools.

The model references Gauch's full-disclosure principle, van Gelder's screen, and Leebron's SAILS framework. These encourage teams to examine whether a solution is strategically, financially, operationally, prudentially, ethically, and legally sound, and whether it is accountable, impactful, leveraged, and sustainable.

## Migration capability research (v1 honest · 2026-07-13)

Role-specific capability research for **LegalAgent** (`video.legal`, va_id=93, category `10-Sup`).

### Responsibility focus
Performs final legal review for novel or high-risk publication issues

### Prompt research topics (source of truth for S3)
- arXiv topics: 1. Retrieve and integrate state-of-the-art research findings from arXiv papers relevant to: AI compliance agents, media law automation, content moderation, continuity checking, template systems, finance ops agents
- X topics: 2. Analyze and incorporate expert insights from x.ai (Twitter/X) from recognized industry and academic leaders specializing in: AI compliance media, content safety agents, continuity AI
- YouTube topics: 3. Extract detailed, actionable technical guidance from high-quality YouTube content created by domain experts focused on: compliance automation for media, AI content safety, continuity supervision AI

### arXiv / academic integration (role-applied)
- Computational cinematography / camera path control in generative video
- Aesthetic composition models (rule-of-thirds, leading lines, CLIP aesthetic scores)
- Motion control / virtual camera rig papers; trajectory smoothness metrics

**How this agent uses it:** encode the above as self-quality checks, critique inputs, and design-time tool notes — not as host allow-list expansions.

### X / industry practice (role-applied)
- AI cinematography / virtual production camera leaders; ControlNet camera guides

### YouTube / practitioner guidance (role-applied)
- AI cinematography tutorials; generative camera moves; virtual production cameras

### Implementation notes for v1
1. Emit artifacts matching role responsibility; self-score against Self-quality criteria.
2. Accept critique only from listed critics; escalate disputes to Judge/Gate as DNA dictates.
3. Design-time tools remain documented only; runtime tools stay in `agent_spec.json`.
4. N1: no second control plane; video logic under `business/video/**` only.

### Research depth note (honest)
This v1 section maps **role-family** literature and the agent’s migration prompt topics into SPEC.
It is **not** a full unsummarized download of every paper/video transcript.
Live primary-source expansion remains a residual for score 100 on S3 where depth is still thin.
