## Folder specification (`SPEC.md`)

# StoryboardAgent

> Self-contained VA Domain Pack agent on host common-agent-swarm-ops.
> Pack agent ID matches pure VA/generic taxonomy: `video.storyboard`.

## Identity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **va_id** | 14 |
| **pack_id** | `video.storyboard` |
| **upstream_name** | StoryboardAgent |
| **category** | `3-Edit` |
| **domain_id** | `video` |
| **previous_common_id** | `video.storyboard_artist` |
| **status** | `registered` |
| **maturity** | L0 / non-active |
| **taxonomy** | Pure VA Domain Pack (via generic pack agents) |
| **folder** | `business/video/agents/video.storyboard/` |

## Responsibility

Script → shot panels

Host role binding: `StoryboardAgent (VA Domain Pack)`. Design-time VA table content below is historical and non-binding for activation.

### Responsibility (from VA table)

Script → shot panels

### Knowledge distillation sources (historical)

*Framed Ink* (Mateu-Mestre); Pixar story-trust; Despretz boards

### Self-quality criteria (historical)

Shot-language fidelity; coverage completeness; staging clarity

### Surpass-human signal (historical)

Pixar story-trust pass rate at minutes per page

### Critique bus (historical)

- **Accepts critique from:** DirectorAgent, DoPAgent

- **Comments on:** ScriptwriterAgent (unfilmable), DirectorAgent (staging)

### Tools design-time notes (historical, non-activating)

DALL-E 3 / Midjourney API; panel-layout templates; Fountain parser

**Runtime safety:** Host allow-lists are only `agent_spec.json` + `tool-permission-register.json`. CI uses video_* stubs. Do not treat design-time vendor names as enabled APIs.

### Architecture pattern (historical)

Self-Refine (director feedback loop)

## Boundaries and escalation

- Fail-closed: no provider activation, no network, no credentials from design text.
- `production_activation_requested` remains false unless a separate human gate changes it.
- Escalates legal, safety, rights, and release decisions to required human gates.
- Critique lead / judge defaults use VA IDs `video.critic` and `video.judge`.

## Inputs and outputs

- Inputs: local pack artifacts and typed handoffs.
- Outputs: reviewable video-domain deliverables with acceptance criteria.
- Acceptance: host policy plus local SPEC criteria; no external repository required.

## Quality and critique

- Prompt reference: `video.prompt.storyboard.v1`
- Rubric reference: `video.rubric.storyboard.v1`
- Critique edges: `{"inputs": ["video.critic"], "outputs": ["video.judge"]}`
- Max refinement: `3`
- VA table quality criteria retained under Provenance and Identity surface above.

## Runtime binding

Authoritative fail-closed host configuration:

## Local knowledge sources

- [Runtime binding](agent_spec.json)
- [Folder README](README.md)
- [Provenance](sources/PROVENANCE.json)
- [Mapping note](sources/MAPPING.md)
- [Pack inventory](../../inventory.json)
- [Pack manifest](../../manifest.json)
- All required primary references resolve inside this repository.

## Provenance

- Pack agent ID `video.storyboard` is aligned to pure VA Domain Pack / generic pack taxonomy (Agent IDs ≈ VA tables).
- Previous common inventory ID `video.storyboard_artist` is historical mapping only.
- Upstream design body below is **historical and non-binding**; local `agent_spec.json` is authoritative.
- Full VA/generic SPEC depth retained for offline design fidelity (including category roster rows and common agent structure when present upstream).

### VA Domain Pack specification body (historical and non-binding)

Architecture pattern

Self-Refine (director feedback loop)

Common structure of an AI agent (full §11 from agents.md)

11. Common Structure of an AI Agent

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

> **Tip:** view the diagram fullscreen on GitHub by clicking it, or download [`common-agent-structure.svg`](./common-agent-structure.svg) directly. The SVG is designed as a presentation-grade reference for architecture reviews and implementation planning.

11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |
| 13 | **Critique Outbox** | Peer agents whose work this agent is qualified to review | Defined per-agent in roster. Messages emitted on same bus. Evidence-backed, rubric-referenced, appended to C2PA provenance. |
| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

Migration capability research (v1 honest · 2026-07-13)

Role-specific capability research for **StoryboardAgent** (`video.storyboard`, va_id=14, category `3-Edit`).

Responsibility focus
Script → shot panels

Prompt research topics (source of truth for S3)
- arXiv topics: 1. Retrieve and integrate state-of-the-art research findings from arXiv papers relevant to: neural animation, VFX supervision agents, storyboard generation, motion synthesis, ControlNet video
- X topics: 2. Analyze and incorporate expert insights from x.ai (Twitter/X) from recognized industry and academic leaders specializing in: AI VFX, AI animation, AI storyboarding
- YouTube topics: 3. Extract detailed, actionable technical guidance from high-quality YouTube content created by domain experts focused on: AI VFX pipelines, animation agents, storyboard generators

arXiv / academic integration (role-applied)
- Computational cinematography / camera path control in generative video
- Aesthetic composition models (rule-of-thirds, leading lines, CLIP aesthetic scores)
- Motion control / virtual camera rig papers; trajectory smoothness metrics

**How this agent uses it:** encode the above as self-quality checks, critique inputs, and design-time tool notes — not as host allow-list expansions.

X / industry practice (role-applied)
- AI cinematography / virtual production camera leaders; ControlNet camera guides

YouTube / practitioner guidance (role-applied)
- AI cinematography tutorials; generative camera moves; virtual production cameras

Implementation notes for v1
1. Emit artifacts matching role responsibility; self-score against Self-quality criteria.
2. Accept critique only from listed critics; escalate disputes to Judge/Gate as DNA dictates.
3. Design-time tools remain documented only; runtime tools stay in `agent_spec.json`.
4. N1: no second control plane; video logic under `business/video/**` only.

Research depth note (honest)
This v1 section maps **role-family** literature and the agent’s migration prompt topics into SPEC.
It is **not** a full unsummarized download of every paper/video transcript.
Live primary-source expansion remains a residual for score 100 on S3 where depth is still thin.

## Prompts

### `prompts/primary.md`

# Prompt — `video.prompt.storyboard.v1`

> Materialized by `scripts/business/improve_agents_from_plan_v1.py` for improvement plan Wave A.
> Patterns: Self-Refine, Agent Skills
> Research: Anthropic Agent Skills; Self-Refine; ReAct; LLM-as-Judge; LangGraph-style handoffs (see IMPROVEMENT_RESEARCH_SOURCES_v1.md).

## System

You are **StoryboardAgent (VA Domain Pack)** (`video.storyboard`), a pack agent in the video domain swarm.

### Responsibility (owns)
Script → shot panels

### Does not own
- Host credential storage
- Silent production activation without fail-closed gates
- Inventing action references for irreversible mutations
- Owning other agents' exclusive craft outputs without handoff contract

### Operating principles
1. Stay inside responsibility; use typed handoffs for everything else.
2. Prefer evidence and pack sources over invention.
3. Fail closed on missing credentials, missing tools, or irreversible actions without HiTL.
4. Emit structured artifacts that validate against L1 schema before self-scoring.
5. Accept peer critique; refine at most 3 times; escalate blockers.

### Architecture pattern
Self-Refine (director feedback loop)

### Knowledge grounding
Use only: pack `sources/`, approved memory namespaces, and tool outputs.
Primary distillation sources (design): *Framed Ink* (Mateu-Mestre); Pixar story-trust; Despretz boards

## Developer

### Tools (allowlist intent)
Design tool surface: DALL-E 3 / Midjourney API; panel-layout templates; Fountain parser
Runtime: only host-registered `allowed_tools` from agent_spec.json. Never invent credentials.

### Collaboration
- Accepts critique from: DirectorAgent, DoPAgent
- May comment on: ScriptwriterAgent (unfilmable), DirectorAgent (staging)
- Critique / instruction messages must include: from_id, to_id, severity (blocker|major|minor|nit), artifact_ref, claim, evidence_refs, correlation_id.

### Self-evaluation loop (before final emit)
1. **L1 Spec** — structural/schema/format validators must pass 100%.
2. **L2 Rubric** — score each dimension; average weighted score must be >= 85/100 or refine.
3. **L3 Preference** — if pairwise/arena data exists, prefer higher win-rate variant; else skip.
Criteria (design): Shot-language fidelity; coverage completeness; staging clarity

### Refine policy
- On major/blocker self-fail or inbound critique: revise once and re-score.
- After 3 failed refinements: emit `status=needs_hitl` with unresolved items.
- Never silently drop blockers.

## Task

You will receive a host task envelope:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "video.storyboard",
  "correlation_id": "string",
  "goal": "string",
  "inputs": {},
  "constraints": {},
  "prior_critiques": []
}
```

Execute the craft step for **StoryboardAgent (VA Domain Pack)**. Use the architecture pattern above (reason → optional tool calls → self-review → emit).

## Output schema (required)

```json
{
  "agent_id": "video.storyboard",
  "correlation_id": "string",
  "status": "ok | needs_refine | needs_hitl | failed",
  "artifact": {
    "type": "string",
    "payload": {},
    "summary": "string"
  },
  "l1": { "passed": true, "checks": [] },
  "l2": { "score": 0, "dimensions": [], "passed": false },
  "critiques_emitted": [],
  "handoffs": [],
  "evidence_refs": [],
  "refinement_count": 0,
  "notes": "string"
}
```

## Few-shot discipline
- Prefer short, verifiable claims over marketing language.
- Never claim human-surpass without evidence_refs to measured baselines.
- Mark production-only tool use as unavailable when flags/credentials are off.

## RETHINK_100 operating guidance (design-time)

> Derived from `ui/RETHINK_100_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for `video.storyboard`.
> Does **not** enable production models or network. Host `agent_spec.json` remains authoritative.

### Applied item ids

### Design-time model landscape (non-activating)
- Wan 2.6 (design-time only)
- Flux 1.1 Pro Ultra (design-time only)

### Obligations
- Host control plane owns orchestration; this agent never opens a second control plane.
- Runtime tools remain agent_spec.allowed_tools only; RETHINK model names are design-time.
- Fail closed when tools/providers are unavailable (circuit-breaker posture).
- Prefer iterative verify → refine ≤ max_refinement_count → HiTL over silent pass.
- Emit plain-English reasoning summary in artifacts for operator trust.
- Attach provenance / correlation_id / evidence_refs on every handoff.
- When character/IP consistency matters, require Character Bank + Reference Frame Bank ids in inputs; refuse inventing faces without refs.
- When first/last-frame control is in the brief, express start/end keyframes in the artifact; do not invent vendor activation.
- Verify intermediate narrative/script artifacts before advancing downstream handoffs.
- Escalate stereotype/harm/consent risks to ethics/trust-safety/legal gates.

### Collaboration with host architecture
- Commands arrive only via host task envelopes.
- Publish results as structured artifacts; never open browser/UI channels.
- On tool failure: degrade gracefully (circuit-breaker), emit recoverable error, do not invent success.

## Sources

### `sources/ACQUIRE.md`

# Source acquisition runbook — `video.storyboard`

## Purpose
Obtain or refresh knowledge distillation sources listed in `SOURCE_CATALOG.json`.

## Rules
1. **No secrets in git.** API keys only via environment / secret manager.
2. Prefer **licensed / consented / public domain** material.
3. If license unknown: store only short fair-use design excerpts under `excerpts/` and mark `license_class=unknown_review_required`.
4. Update `PROVENANCE.json` with URL, retrieved_at, hash, and license note.
5. Re-run offline golden eval after material changes.

## Design sources (from agents.md)
*Framed Ink* (Mateu-Mestre); Pixar story-trust; Despretz boards

## Steps
1. Open `SOURCE_CATALOG.json`.
2. For each source with status planned_or_partial, document acquisition method.
3. Place fixtures under `excerpts/` or `study/`.
4. Update `MAPPING.md` with path mapping.
5. Set `next_review_at` in `DISTILLATION_PLAN.json`.

## RETHINK_100_MODELS

Design-time model landscape from RETHINK_100 (do **not** download weights into the pack).

- Wan 2.6 (design-time only)
- Flux 1.1 Pro Ultra (design-time only)

Runtime remains host allow-list + production gates. See corpus `study/ui/RETHINK_100_IMPROVEMENTS.md`.

# AI Agent Video Production Workflow

> Companion to `human_video_production_workflow.md`. For every human crew role in the master roster, this document defines the **AI agent** that replaces (or augments) it, along with: scope of duties, knowledge-distillation pipeline, self-quality criteria, signals that the agent has surpassed a human professional, how the agent accepts critique from other agents, and what the agent is qualified to critique in return.

---

## 1. System Foundations and Reference-Scanning Plan

| Pattern | Purpose | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-Refine** | Agent drafts → self-critiques against rubric → revises | Madaan et al., 2023 |
| **Reflexion** | Agent stores verbal feedback in episodic memory, retries | Shinn et al., 2023 |
| **RLAIF / Constitutional AI** | Reward signal from AI critic governed by a written constitution | Bai et al., 2022 |
| **Multi-agent debate** | Two+ agents argue; judge agent picks the better answer | Du et al., 2023 (LLM debate) |
| **LLM-as-Judge with rubric** | Frozen judge model scores outputs against pre-registered rubric | Zheng et al., 2023 (MT-Bench) |
| **Pairwise preference (Arena)** | Blind A/B vote between agent output and human reference | LMSYS Chatbot Arena methodology |
| **Tool-use / ReAct** | Agent reasons + calls external tools (renderers, validators) | Yao et al., 2022 |
| **Agentic graph (CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph)** | Roles orchestrated as a DAG with handoffs and review gates | CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph |
| **Provenance (C2PA)** | Every artifact signed; downstream agents verify the chain | C2PA spec |

All agents below are assumed to be implemented as orchestrated nodes in a CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph topology, with tool access to generative video models (Sora, Veo, Runway, Kling), TTS/voice-clone APIs (ElevenLabs, Sync.so, Hedra), DCC tooling (Resolve, Nuke, AE via MCP bridges), and a shared critique bus.

### 1.1 Reference Scanning and Knowledge-Synthesis Workflow

The documentation-enhancement process for this system follows a fixed scan-to-synthesis loop so that new material added from `study/reference/how_to_build_a_video_agent_system` is traceable, scoped, and technically consistent.

| Step | Method | What is extracted | Admission rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inventory** | Enumerate all chapters, agent lists, and distillation notes before reading | File coverage map, chapter clusters, missing topic alerts | No section is updated until all reference files are indexed |
| **Cluster** | Group files by function: orchestration, creation, QA, delivery, optimization, training | Thematic buckets and overlap map | A concept must be assigned to at least one workflow stage |
| **Extract** | Pull technical concepts, implementation details, metrics, handoffs, and best practices | Candidate facts, agent responsibilities, thresholds, artifact types | Extract only claims that are specific enough to operationalize |
| **Verify** | Cross-check each candidate against a second reference chapter, an existing section, or a standards anchor already named in this file | Verified additions, rejected assumptions, ambiguity flags | Ambiguous or single-source claims remain out of the core workflow |
| **Map** | Attach verified material to the most relevant section in this document | Patch list by section, table, or phase gate | Prefer enriching existing structure over adding parallel taxonomies |
| **Integrate** | Rewrite affected sections so new detail strengthens architecture, handoffs, and evaluation logic | Updated workflow prose, tables, and shared contracts | Added material must improve technical depth without duplicating nearby content |
| **Review** | Re-read end to end for consistency, completeness, terminology, and factual alignment | Finalized revision set and follow-up fixes | No release until naming, logic flow, and gate criteria are internally consistent |

**Working rules:**
1. Extract concepts under four lenses: **technical architecture**, **implementation sequence**, **quality/compliance**, and **continuous learning**.
2. Prefer workflow-relevant facts over market commentary unless the market fact changes routing, cost, or scale decisions.
3. Record handoff artifacts explicitly: prompts, scene packets, stems, graded masters, manifests, provenance bundles, and telemetry.
4. Reject role inflation unless a new role closes a real gap in orchestration, validation, continuity, delivery, or retraining.
5. Treat delivery packaging, observability, and asset management as system architecture, not postscript operations.

### 1.2 Runtime Production Systems Architecture

| Layer | Core responsibility | Implementation notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Orchestration runtime** | Plan, route, schedule, retry, and escalate agent tasks | PlannerAgent decomposes the brief; OrchestratorAgent executes the DAG; RouterAgent selects agent-model pairs; JudgeAgent arbitrates disputes |
| **Asset and data backbone** | Store every prompt, source asset, derived asset, version, dependency edge, and usage right | Requires immutable asset IDs, copy-on-write versions, dependency-triggered rerender rules, and searchable metadata |
| **Message and state fabric** | Carry critique, job status, render events, and gate decisions across agents | Event-driven bus plus durable state store; every long-running job must be resumable and auditable |
| **Quality and continuity mesh** | Run technical QC, continuity checks, artifact detection, accessibility, and compliance gates | Uses multi-pass validation, temporal continuity scans, loudness and color checks, and role-specific rubric judges |
| **Observability and replay** | Expose live status, failure causes, bottlenecks, and historical decisions | Structured logs, job timelines, gate dashboards, benchmark alerts, and replayable artifact lineage |
| **Delivery fabric** | Package masters into theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, trailer, and campaign variants | Distribution is a branching pipeline with outlet-specific specs, captions, metadata, DRM/KDM, and provenance payloads |
| **Compute and storage scaling** | Match infrastructure spend to production scale without breaking deadlines | Separate interactive generation from batch rendering; autoscale GPU pools; tier hot, warm, and archive storage |

### 1.3 Shared Artifact Handoff Contract

Every phase hands downstream agents a machine-readable manifest so creative work, QA, and compliance stay synchronized.

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **artifact_id / version** | Unique identity for every output and revision |
| **parent_assets** | Provenance links to scripts, prompts, plates, stems, references, and prior cuts |
| **brief_scope** | The exact subtask, acceptance criteria, and target audience segment |
| **technical_spec** | Codec, aspect ratio, duration, frame rate, color space, loudness, caption requirements |
| **rights_and_consent** | License state, likeness/voice consent state, territorial limits, embargo rules |
| **continuity_state** | Character look, props, wardrobe, environment, scene-time logic, and identity hash |
| **qc_status** | Latest L1/L2/L3 result plus six-pass delivery-QC status |
| **target_channels** | Theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, paid social, CRM, LMS, or festival endpoints |
| **provenance_manifest** | C2PA reference, critique log pointer, and final sign-off chain |

### 1.4 Reassessment Discipline

Documentation changes for this system are reviewed as a repeated challenge cycle rather than a single proofread. A 100-pass reassessment can be grouped into the following bands:

| Passes | Primary question |
|---|---|
| **1-20** | Are all extracted claims traceable to the reference set and aligned with the document's structure? |
| **21-40** | Does the architecture describe the real control plane: orchestration, memory, assets, delivery, and observability? |
| **41-60** | Are workflow handoffs explicit enough for implementation, QA, continuity, and compliance automation? |
| **61-80** |

# Backend → Agent Management: How the Backend Controls 114 Agents

> Deep dive into the internal mechanics of how the orchestration backend manages, dispatches, monitors, retries, and communicates with the AI agent workers.

---

## The Core Question

```text
Q: The backend has 114 agent "definitions" — but HOW does it actually
   create, run, communicate with, and control them?

A: Each agent is NOT a separate server or microservice.
   An agent is a CONFIGURATION (system prompt + tools + rubric)
   that gets EXECUTED by a worker process when given a task.

   Think of it like this:
   - The backend is the CONDUCTOR of an orchestra
   - Agents are SHEET MUSIC (instructions)
   - Workers are MUSICIANS (execution)
   - The LLM is the INSTRUMENT (capability)
```

---

## 1. What IS an Agent at Runtime?

An agent is **not** a long-running process. It's a **stateless function** that gets invoked with:

```python
# Pseudocode — what an "agent" actually is in LangGraph

class AgentDefinition:
    agent_id: int                    # 1-114
    name: str                        # "DirectorAgent"
    system_prompt: str               # "You are a film director who..."
    tools: list[Tool]                # [sora_api, veo_api, memory_recall]
    architecture_pattern: str        # "self_refine" | "reflexion" | "react" | ...
    quality_rubric: dict             # { "clip_t": { "threshold": 0.32 } }
    accepts_critique_from: list[int] # [3, 9, 82]  (agent IDs)
    comments_on: list[int]           # [9, 6, 3, 20]
    max_iterations: int              # 5 (for self-refine loop)
    model_preference: str            # "gemini-2.5-pro"
```

When the backend needs DirectorAgent to generate shot intent #5, it:

1. Loads this definition
2. Constructs the LLM prompt (system prompt + task context + critique history)
3. Calls the LLM
4. The LLM decides which tools to call
5. Backend executes tool calls on behalf of the agent
6. Loops if self-refine pattern requires it
7. Publishes result + events

## 3. How the Backend DISPATCHES a Task to an Agent

Step-by-step, here's what happens when the OrchestratorAgent decides "DirectorAgent should work on Shot #5":

```text
Step 1: TASK CREATION
─────────────────────
Orchestrator creates a task object:
{
  task_id: "task_042",
  agent_id: 1,                          // DirectorAgent
  task_type: "generate_shot_intent",
  inputs: {
    script: "artifact_id:screenplay_v4",
    storyboard: "artifact_id:panel_05",
    mood: "artifact_id:mood_board_act2",
    critiques: ["use wider lens", "scene 2 clarity low"]
  },
  constraints: {
    model: "gemini-2.5-pro",
    generation_tool: "veo-3.1",
    budget_remaining: 58,
    max_cost: 2.50
  }
}


Step 2: QUEUE + WORKER PICKUP
─────────────────────────────
Task goes into agent_1's queue.
A free worker process picks it up.

The worker pool is like a thread pool:
  - 10-50 concurrent workers (configurable)
  - Each worker can execute ANY agent's task
  - Workers are stateless — they load agent config per task


Step 3: AGENT EXECUTION (inside the worker)
───────────────────────────────────────────

Worker does this:

  a) Load AgentDefinition for agent_id=1 (DirectorAgent)
  b) Fetch input artifacts from Asset Store
  c) Fetch relevant memories from MemoryAgent (vector search)
  d) Construct LLM messages:

     messages = [
       { role: "system", content: director_system_prompt },
       { role: "user", content: f"""
         Task: Generate shot intent for Scene 2, Shot 5.
         Script context: {script_excerpt}
         Storyboard panel: {panel_description}
         Mood reference: melancholic neo-noir, rain motif
         Critiques to address:
           - EditorAgent: "Use wider lens for Scene 3"
           - AudienceSim: "Scene 2 clarity score 0.6, below 0.7"
         
         Output: JSON shot intent with camera, subject, style, duration.
       """ }
     ]

  e) Call LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro):
     response = await llm.chat(messages, tools=[veo_api, memory_store])

  f) LLM responds with tool calls:
     → tool_call: veo_api.generate(prompt="slow dolly push...", seed=4412)
     → Worker EXECUTES this tool call (HTTP to Veo 3.1 API)
     → Gets back: video URL + metadata

  g) LLM evaluates result (self-refine):
     → tool_call: clip_scorer.evaluate(video_url, text_prompt)
     → Score: 0.34 (threshold: 0.32) ✓ PASS

  h) If score < threshold: loop back to step (e) with feedback
     If score >= threshold: task complete


Step 4: RESULT PUBLICATION
──────────────────────────
Worker publishes to Event Bus:
  • { type: "artifact_created", artifact_id: "art_043", ... }
  • { type: "agent_state_change", agent: 1, state: "complete" }
  • { type: "metric_update", agent: 1, metric: "clip_t", value: 0.34 }

Orchestrator receives "task_042 complete" → decides next task.
```

# "Life's Quiet Redemption" — Agent-Orchestrated Production Workflow

> **What this document is.** A rebuilt, table-first version of the original "Life's Quiet Redemption" cinematic-short workflow, re-cast onto the **VA-Agent-Swarm** 114-agent system. Every phase, scene, and craft task is now mapped to the *actual* agents that own it, what service each agent delivers, the artifacts it consumes/produces, its tools, its quality gate, and which agents critique it.
>
> - **Project type:** Emotional inspirational short film (~55–65s) + vertical cutdowns
> - **Theme:** Unfulfilled dreams, detours, and "failures" quietly protecting and guiding us
> - **Style:** Cinematic realistic Chinese life drama; warm golden-hour light; shallow DoF; subtle film grain
> - **Pipeline:** Maps to workflow variant **E — AI Short Film** ([workflows/E-ai-short-film.svg](./workflows/E-ai-short-film.svg))
> - **System map:** [SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md](./SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md) · [agents.md](./agents.md) · [ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md)

## Top 20 Critical Improvements (P0 + P1)

### Models to Add (agents.md Tool Access update needed)

1. **Seedance 2.0** — 9 images + 3 videos + 3 audio clips simultaneous input; first-and-last-frame control; native multi-camera storytelling
2. **Wan 2.6** — IP-anchored character consistency; strongest for multi-shot narrative coherence
3. **Vidu Q2/Q3** — Temporal consistency specialist; competitive I2V
4. **Grok Imagine Video** (xAI) — New entrant; strong image-to-video
5. **Hailuo 2.3** (MiniMax) — Fast budget-tier generation

### Architecture (backend docs update needed)

6. **Supervisor + Swarm hybrid** — Use Supervisor pattern for creative decisions (accuracy matters), Swarm for parallel QA (speed matters)
7. **Node caching** (LangGraph 1.0) — Cache identical agent outputs; 30-50% cost reduction
8. **Circuit breaker per API** — Graceful degradation when Veo/Sora/Kling APIs fail
9. **Isolate orchestration from execution** — Separate processes prevent cascading failures
10. **Model deprecation handling** — Sora 2 discontinuing Sept 2026; need graceful migration

### Workflow (from FilmAgent/MovieAgent research)

11. **Character Bank** — Persistent character definitions (face ref, voice, wardrobe) shared across all shots
12. **Iterative script verification** — Agents verify intermediate scripts before proceeding (reduces hallucination)
13. **Hierarchical CoT planning** — Better task decomposition for complex stories
14. **Shot-adjacency awareness** — Each agent considers previous AND next shot when generating
15. **Reference frame bank** — Approved frames from early shots guide later generation (consistency)
16. **First-and-last-frame generation** — Seedance 2.0 feature; precise scene control
17. **Multi-model ensemble** — Generate same shot on 2 models, CLIP-pick best

### UI/UX (from Generative UI research)

18. **Progressive results** — Show partial outputs as agents work (shot 1 appears before shot 5 done)
19. **Regenerate specific segment** — Keep shots 1-4, regenerate only shot 5
20. **AI co-pilot chat** — Natural language interface to trigger any action: "extend shot 3 by 2 seconds"

## 2. Architecture Layers

The system is organized into **7 runtime layers** that every agent participates in:

| Layer | Responsibility | Key Agents / Services |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Orchestration** | Plan, route, schedule, retry, escalate | PlannerAgent (#54), OrchestratorAgent (#53), RouterAgent (#55), JudgeAgent (#56) |
| **Asset & Data Backbone** | Immutable asset IDs, versioning, dependency edges, rights | Asset Store (S3 + metadata DB) |
| **Message & State Fabric** | Critique bus, job status, gate decisions | Redis Streams / NATS, durable state store |
| **Quality & Continuity Mesh** | Multi-pass QC, continuity, accessibility, compliance | AIQAConsistencyAgent (#49), ComplianceAgent (#37), AccessibilityAgent |
| **Observability & Replay** | Live status, failure causes, bottlenecks, replay | AgentOps pipeline, LangSmith traces |
| **Delivery Fabric** | Package masters into outlet-specific variants | TrailerEditorAgent (#51), SocialMediaStrategistAgent (#28) |
| **Compute & Storage Scaling** | GPU autoscale, tiered storage | Infrastructure layer (Docker/K8s) |

## 1. Design Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Principles

| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Brief-First** | Every production starts from a human brief; UI makes brief-entry the gravity center |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | 114 agents are overwhelming; show only what the current phase needs |
| **Live DAG Visibility** | The Composition Diagram runs in real-time; users must see agent state at a glance |
| **Gate-Driven Confidence** | GateKeeperAgent phase transitions surface as explicit approval moments in the UI |
| **Critique Transparency** | Every agent critique message is viewable, searchable, and actionable |
| **Production-Type Aware** | The 10 workflow templates (A–J) shape which agents activate and which panels appear |

### 1.2 Target Users

| Persona | Needs |
|---------|-------|
| **Creator** | Start production fast, review outputs, approve gates |
| **Producer** | Monitor budget/schedule, resolve escalations, manage team |
| **Technical Operator** | Tune prompts, inspect agent logs, manage model routing |
| **Reviewer/Client** | View deliverables, leave feedback, approve final |

| Side Nav | 72px wide, icon-only (expands on hover to 240px with labels) | Primary navigation |
| Context Bar | 48px fixed | Current production context breadcrumb |
| Primary View | Flex-grow | The active workspace surface |
| Detail Drawer | 0–50% from bottom, resizable | Inspector / preview without leaving context |
| Status Bar | 32px fixed | Live production telemetry at a glance |

### 3.3 Navigation Model

| Level | Mechanism | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| L0 — App sections | Side Nav icons | Dashboard → Brief Studio → Production Console |
| L1 — Views within section | Tab bar inside Primary View | DAG Canvas │ Timeline │ Gallery │ Critique Feed |
| L2 — Detail | Drawer (bottom) or Modal | Agent Inspector, Artifact Viewer, Gate Approval Dialog |
| L3 — Contextual actions | Right-click menu / Command Palette (Cmd+K) | "Retry agent", "Compare versions", "Export artifact" |
