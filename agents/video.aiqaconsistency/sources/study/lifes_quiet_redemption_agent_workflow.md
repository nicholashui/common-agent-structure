# "Life's Quiet Redemption" — Agent-Orchestrated Production Workflow

> **What this document is.** A rebuilt, table-first version of the original "Life's Quiet Redemption" cinematic-short workflow, re-cast onto the **VA-Agent-Swarm** 114-agent system. Every phase, scene, and craft task is now mapped to the *actual* agents that own it, what service each agent delivers, the artifacts it consumes/produces, its tools, its quality gate, and which agents critique it.
>
> - **Project type:** Emotional inspirational short film (~55–65s) + vertical cutdowns
> - **Theme:** Unfulfilled dreams, detours, and "failures" quietly protecting and guiding us
> - **Style:** Cinematic realistic Chinese life drama; warm golden-hour light; shallow DoF; subtle film grain
> - **Pipeline:** Maps to workflow variant **E — AI Short Film** ([workflows/E-ai-short-film.svg](./workflows/E-ai-short-film.svg))
> - **System map:** [SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md](./SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md) · [agents.md](./agents.md) · [ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md)

## 4. Cross-Cutting Services Applied Throughout

These shared capabilities (SYSTEM_REFERENCE §4–§5) operate across every phase, not at a single node.

| Service / Capability | Provided By | Role on This Film |
|---|---|---|
| **Aesthetics scoring (Critic + Aligner + Taste-Keeper)** | Aesthetics Agent | Supplies the L2/perceptual "is this beautiful + warm?" judge signal to Cinematographer, Colorist, PromptEngineer, AIQA |
| **Strategic Goal Achievement (6-stage self-inquiry)** | Strategic Goal framework | Turns the vague "make people feel life saved them" goal into measurable creative targets for Planner/Director |
| **Agentic RAG knowledge backbone** | Agentic RAG System | Serves Chinese cinematic references, golden-hour lighting recipes, prompt patterns to any agent on demand |
| **Psychological profiling / recommendation** | Psych Profile + Recommendation agents | Tunes narrator tone and audience-resonance prediction (Big Five / emotional state) for AudienceSim and Personalization |
| **Continuous self-improvement (Reflexion + RLAIF)** | Optimization Agent + EvaluationHarnessAgent (#79) | Feeds 30/60/90-day retention/ROAS back into prompt + edit choices for the next film in the series |
| **Shared Artifact Handoff Contract (C2PA-signed manifests)** | All agents | Every clip, stem, and master carries `artifact_id`, `continuity_state`, `qc_status`, `provenance_manifest` between phases |
| **Critique Bus (CritiqueMessage JSON)** | All agents | Structured blocker/major/minor feedback; disputes escalate to JudgeAgent → HiTL |

---

## 5. Quality Gate Ladder (Per Shot & Per Phase)

Every artifact clears three layers before GateKeeperAgent advances it (agents.md §11.2).

| Layer | Question | Owner / Mechanism | Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1 — Spec** | Did it meet the structured brief (codec, aspect, duration, frame count)? | JSON schema + tool validators | 100% pass |
| **L2 — Rubric** | Does it meet the craft rubric (composition, grade, prosody, beat fit)? | LLM-as-Judge + Aesthetics Agent | ≥85/100 (≤3 Self-Refine iters) |
| **L3 — Preference** | Would the target audience pick this over a human-made baseline? | AudienceSimAgent (#82) pairwise panel + HiTL sample | Win ≥50% (parity) / ≥55% (surpass) |

---

## 6. Delivery Variants & Outlet Specs

## 8. Series & Scalability (Reusing the Swarm)

Because the swarm persists character bibles (MemoryAgent #58), identity hashes (AvatarDesignAgent #47), and style LoRAs (StyleTransferAgent #61), a follow-up short reuses ~70% of pre-production. New entries in the 「生活偷偷救赎了我们」 series only re-run Phases 1–4 for new beats, while ContinuityAgent guarantees the recurring "map girl" and "shop cat" stay consistent across episodes.

| Reuse Asset | Stored By | Enables |
|---|---|---|
| Character bible + identity hashes | MemoryAgent, AvatarDesignAgent | Same faces across episodes |
| Style LoRAs + grade LUT | StyleTransferAgent, ColoristAgent | Consistent "warm memory" look |
| 旁白 voice clone | VoiceCloneAgent | Recognizable narrator across series |
| Prompt + seed registry | PromptEngineerAgent | Fast, reproducible re-renders |
| Recurring motifs (cat, paper map) | ContinuityAgent | Audience recognition / brand |

## 10. YouTube Marketing Upgrades (mapped to agents)

| Upgrade | What Changes | Owning Agents | Gate / Metric |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Package-first** | Title (≤50 chars, simple words) + thumbnail concept are locked in Phase 1, *before* any generation; the film is made to deliver that promise | BrandStrategistAgent (#85), SEOAgent (#87), Thumbnail=ConceptArtistAgent (#15), DirectorAgent (#1) | CTR predicted ≥ niche median (AudienceSimAgent panel) |
| **Outlier modeling** | Idea is chosen by modeling over-performing videos in the 治愈/reflective-life niche | TrendIntelligenceAgent (#68), AnalystAgent (#81), IdeationAgent (#59) | Idea maps to ≥3 proven outliers |
| **Engineered opener** | First 3–5s re-cut as a hook: strongest image (Scene 1 ECU or Scene 10 warmth) + a curiosity-gap 旁白 line, instead of a slow fade-in | RetentionOptimizerAgent (#76), EditorAgent (#9), ScreenwriterAgent (#3) | First-60s retention ≥ target band |
| **Segment retention bands** | Map the 60s into hook / build / payoff with explicit retention floors per segment, modeled on MrBeast's segmentation | RetentionOptimizerAgent (#76), EmotionalArcAgent (#65) | Per-segment predicted retention ≥ floor |
| **Shorts 3s-hold cut** | Dedicated 9:16 cut: visual hook on **frame 1**, spoken hook ≤14 words, designed to loop | TrailerEditorAgent (#51), MotionGraphicsAgent (#13) | Predicted 3s-hold ≥60%; clean loop seam |
| **Metric instrumentation** | Track CTR + AVD + AVP as first-class KPIs feeding the next episode | AnalystAgent (#81), EvaluationHarnessAgent (#79) | Dashboard live within 24h of launch |

## 11. Generation Engine Upgrade — Add Grok Imagine to the Stack

The routing in §3.4 (RouterAgent #55) gains a Grok tier. Net effect: cheaper, faster iteration up front; premium engines reserved for hero shots.

| Stage | Engine Choice | Why (cited) | Agent |
|---|---|---|---|
| Divergent draft / variant browse | **Grok Imagine 1.5 Fast** (6s, 720p, ~25s/clip) | Fast enough to try many framings and discard quickly ([x.ai](https://x.ai/news/grok-imagine-video-1-5), [imagine.art](https://www.imagine.art/blogs/xai-grok-imagine-video-1-5-guide)) | PromptEngineerAgent (#46), RouterAgent (#55) |
| Keyframe → motion (identity-safe) | **Grok Imagine 1.5 I2V** (animates the locked keyframe, faithful to source) | Continues the still rather than reinterpreting it, protecting face + lighting ([x.ai](https://x.ai/news/grok-imagine-1-5)) | PromptEngineerAgent (#46), ContinuityAgent (#98) |
| Fast full-film rough cut | **Grok Imagine Agent Mode** (plans/stitches 6s clips, native audio, in-quotes lip-sync) | Produces a stitched draft of the whole arc for early editorial review ([codersera](https://codersera.com/blog/grok-imagine-agent-mode-launch-2026/)) | OrchestratorAgent (#53), EditorAgent (#9) |
| Hero / emotional-peak shots | **Veo 3.1 / Kling 3.0 / Runway Gen-4** | Higher fidelity + camera control for Scenes 1, 5, 10, 12 | CinematographerAgent (#6) |
| Local / privacy-sensitive | **ComfyUI + CharCom LoRAs + IP-Adapter** | Full control, per-character LoRA identity ([arXiv CharCom](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10135v1)) | StyleTransferAgent (#61) |

## 12. Character-Consistency Upgrade (the film's hardest problem)

Replaces "attach a reference image, strength 70–90%" with a research-grade identity stack.

| Technique | Applied To | Mechanism (cited) | Owning Agent | Metric |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mandatory visual anchoring** | Every character shot | Generate a locked keyframe first; never pure T2V — visual priors are essential or consistency collapses ([arXiv 2512.16954](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.16954)) | PromptEngineerAgent (#46) | ID score does not collapse vs anchor |
| **Per-character LoRA (per age)** | A,B,C,E,F,J × young/adult | Composable adapters on a frozen backbone, prompt-aware ([CharCom](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10135v1)) | StyleTransferAgent (#61) | Face similarity ≥0.85 (ArcFace) |
| **RL identity reinforcement** | Multi-person shots (Scene 10 dinner) | Identity-GRPO improved multi-human consistency ~18.9% ([arXiv 2510.14256](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.14256v1)) | AIQAConsistencyAgent (#49) | Per-person drift = 0 across frames |
| **Memory-conditioned generation** | Across all 14 cards | Shot-by-shot diffusion conditioned on prior-shot memory ([StoryMem](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.19539)) | MemoryAgent (#58) + PromptEngineerAgent | Cross-scene coherence pass |
| **Training-free fallback** | Shots lacking a clean portrait | Background+character consistency without references ([BachVid](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.21696v1)) | ContinuityAgent (#98) | Consistency ≥ threshold |
| **Fine-grained ID audit** | QC gate | VLM-based identity-preservation eval beyond global embeddings ([arXiv 2511.08087](https://arxiv.org/html/2511.08087v1)) | AIQAConsistencyAgent (#49) | Fine-grained ID delta below τ |

## 13. Evaluation Upgrade — VBench-Grade QC Scorecard

The §5 gate ladder's L2 is replaced by a multi-dimensional scorecard scored by an MLLM judge (Video-Bench style, chain-of-query) plus motion-perception checks.

| Dimension (VBench/VMBench) | What It Catches on This Film | Threshold | Judge |
|---|---|---|---|
| Subject (identity) consistency | Face/age drift A→E across scenes | ≥0.90 | AIQAConsistencyAgent (#49) |
| Temporal flicker | Shimmer on shop interior / night bokeh | below τ | AIQAConsistencyAgent |
| Motion smoothness | Hands typing (S3), dolly-in (S10) | ≥ rubric | VMBench check ([arXiv 2503.10076](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.10076)) |
| Imaging quality | Grain/sharpness of close-ups | ≥ rubric | Aesthetics Agent |
| Aesthetic quality | "warm memory" look, composition | ≥85/100 | Aesthetics Agent |
| Spatial relationship | Eyeline match S4 monitor reflection | pass | AIQAConsistencyAgent |
| Text–video relevance | Prompt adherence per shot | CLIP-T ≥0.32 | AIQAConsistencyAgent |
| Motion (human-perception) | Natural breath/wind, no jitter | ≥ VMBench band | VMBench ([2503.10076](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.10076)) |

Scoring method: MLLM evaluator with few-shot scoring + chain-of-query ([Video-Bench, arXiv 2504.04907](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.04907v1)), giving diagnostic, per-dimension feedback rather than a single number.

## 14. Orchestration Upgrade — 3E Loop + MCTS Search

| Pattern | Replaces | How It Works (cited) | Where Applied |
|---|---|---|---|
| **3E micro-loop (Explore→Examine→Enhance)** | Single-pass node execution | Each agent first explores options, examines against the rubric, then enhances before handing off ([MAViS, arXiv 2508.08487](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.08487v2)) | Every DAG node (esp. PromptEngineer, Editor, Composer) |
| **MCTS clip search** | Fixed ≤3 re-roll cap | Reviewer agent runs Monte-Carlo tree search over candidate clips to pick the best path ([arXiv 2506.10540](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.10540)) | Hero shots (S1, S5, S10, S12) |
| **Narrative-pacing control** | Manual trims | Keyframe-conditioned pacing knobs tied to the emotion curve ([SmartDirector, arXiv 2605.27891](https://arxiv.org/html/2605.27891v1)) | EditorAgent (#9) ↔ EmotionalArcAgent (#65) |
| **Unified director front-end** | Hand-written shot prompts only | A director model converts the brief into structured multi-shot scripts for non-experts ([UniMAGE, arXiv 2512.23222](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.23222)) | DirectorAgent (#1) + ScreenwriterAgent (#3) |

## 15. Revised Opening & Shorts Cards (concrete deltas)

| Card | Original | Research-Informed Revision |
|---|---|---|
| **Hook (new 0–3s)** | Slow fade into Scene 1 study ECU | Open on the *strongest* warm frame (S10 dinner steam or S1 eyes), with a ≤14-word curiosity-gap 旁白 ("有些愿望没有实现，后来我才懂为什么"), so the first 3s earns the watch ([opus.pro](https://www.opus.pro/blog/youtube-shorts-hook-formulas), [MrBeast breakdown](https://sherwood.news/culture/mrbeast-youtube-leaked-internal-success-document/)) |
| **Title (package-first)** | (none) | ≤50 chars, simple words, locked before generation ([Galloway summary](https://outlierkit.com/resources/youtube-scriptwriting-methods-compared/)) |
| **Shorts cut** | 9:16 smart-crop of main film | Purpose-built: visual hook on frame 1, ≤14-word VO, clean loop seam, optimized for 3s-hold + replay ([rendercut](https://rendercut.io/why-viewers-scroll-away-first-3-seconds/), [findmecreators](https://www.findmecreators.com/blog/youtube-shorts-retention-rate)) |
| **Ending cards** | Static black/white text | Keep — but A/B the *thumbnail+title* pair, not the poem, since packaging drives the click ([Colin & Samir](https://www.colinandsamir.com/resources/the-new-rules-of-youtube-from-paddy-galloway)) |
