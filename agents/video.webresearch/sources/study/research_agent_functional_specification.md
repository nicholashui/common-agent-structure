# Research Agent Functional Specification

## 1. Document Control

- Document title: `Research Agent Functional Specification`
- System name: `grok-research-agent`
- Document type: Current-state functional specification derived from implementation and tests
- Primary delivery model: Local Python CLI application
- Source of truth for this specification: `grok_research_agent/` package implementation, packaged prompts, and automated tests
- Specification intent: Describe the functional behavior the system currently implements, including workflow behavior, file contracts, validation rules, failure handling, and integration points

## 2. Purpose

The system provides a local-first research automation workflow that converts a user-supplied topic into a detailed Markdown research report through a staged pipeline of scope definition, source discovery, source curation, content extraction, notebook assembly, synthesis, optional full-source preservation, final polishing, knowledge compilation, drill-pack generation, image-prompt generation, and YouTube-script generation.

The system is designed to:

- preserve human control at key decision points;
- store all research artifacts locally in resumable session directories;
- use Grok through the xAI OpenAI-compatible API for all LLM generation tasks;
- support optional ingestion of external local documentation as steering context;
- produce inspectable intermediate artifacts rather than a single opaque result.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 In Scope

- Command-line session lifecycle management
- Persistent session state and artifact storage
- Eight-phase research workflow orchestration
- Optional unattended execution mode
- External-document preprocessing for local steering material
- Knowledge-base compilation into hypergraph and core concepts
- Drill-pack generation from compiled concepts
- Hypergraph updates from newly fed documents
- Mermaid rendering of hypergraph data
- Image-prompt generation from final report content
- YouTube-script generation from final report or section drafts

### 3.2 Out of Scope

- Web UI, API server, or multi-user collaboration
- Authentication, authorization, and role-based permissions
- Database-backed persistence
- Semantic vector search or retrieval index
- Automatic browser automation or crawler orchestration beyond direct HTTP fetch
- Guaranteed factual validation of LLM outputs
- Binary document feeding in the `feed` command beyond best-effort text decoding

## 4. Stakeholders, Roles, and External Actors

### 4.1 Human User Roles

- `Research Operator`: Starts sessions, approves or revises workflow outputs, selects curated sources, optionally chooses full offline collection, and runs auxiliary commands
- `Reviewer/Study User`: Consumes generated report, drill pack, hypergraph, Mermaid output, image prompts, or YouTube script; this role is not technically distinct from the operator

### 4.2 System Actors

- `LLM Provider`: xAI Grok, accessed through the OpenAI-compatible API
- `Remote Content Hosts`: Public websites and PDF endpoints referenced by curated sources
- `Local Filesystem`: Stores sessions, state, outputs, external-doc artifacts, and knowledge-base artifacts
- `Local Environment`: Provides `.env` or environment variables, `EDITOR`, and Python runtime

### 4.3 Access Model

- The system implements no internal user accounts and no permission model.
- Any user who can execute the CLI and read/write the target sessions directory can operate the system fully.

## 5. System Context and Architecture

### 5.1 Core Modules

- `grok_research_agent.cli`
  - Parses CLI arguments
  - Creates `SessionManager` and `WorkflowRunner`
  - Maps command failures to process exit codes
- `grok_research_agent.session_manager`
  - Creates and persists session state
  - Creates unique run directories
  - Provides canonical session and knowledge-base paths
- `grok_research_agent.workflow_phases`
  - Implements the workflow state machine
  - Handles source fetching, extraction, synthesis, compilation, drill-pack generation, feed, show, image generation, and YouTube script generation
- `grok_research_agent.grok_client`
  - Loads environment configuration
  - Calls xAI Grok using the OpenAI client
  - Maps API exceptions into domain-specific runtime errors
- `grok_research_agent.external_docs`
  - Recursively ingests supported local docs
  - Extracts steering context, constraints, requirements, and relevance signals
- `grok_research_agent.prompts/*`
  - Defines output contracts and behavioral instructions for LLM calls

### 5.2 Execution Model

- The product is a single-process CLI application.
- Each command creates a new run directory under the target session.
- Commands operate on files in the session directory and may also write run-local copies for traceability.
- Long-lived state is file-based; there is no background daemon.

## 6. Technology and Runtime Dependencies

- Python runtime: `>=3.11`
- Required packages:
  - `openai`
  - `python-dotenv`
  - `rich`
  - `pydantic>=2`
  - `pypdf`
  - `python-docx`
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `readability-lxml`
  - `chardet<6`
- Packaged CLI entrypoint: `grok-research-agent = grok_research_agent.cli:main`
- Convenience wrappers: root-level `main.py` and `cli.py` forward to packaged CLI entrypoint

## 7. Configuration Specification

### 7.1 Environment Variables

- `GROK_API_KEY`
  - Required for any command path that instantiates `GrokClient`
  - Must be non-empty after whitespace trimming
  - If absent, LLM-backed actions shall fail with a clear message
- `GROK_MODEL`
  - Optional
  - Defaults to `grok-3`
  - Blank values shall be normalized back to `grok-3`
- `GROK_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`
  - Optional integer
  - Defaults to `50000`
  - Invalid or non-numeric values shall revert to `50000`
  - Values below `1` shall be clamped to `1`
- `GROK_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
  - Optional integer
  - Defaults to `300`
  - Invalid or non-numeric values shall revert to `300`
  - Values below `1` shall be clamped to `1`
- `EDITOR`
  - Optional
  - Used only during Phase 0 `edit` flow
  - If absent, selecting `edit` shall still create the editable temporary file, but no external editor is launched automatically

### 7.2 `.env` Resolution

- When the workflow constructs a default `GrokClient`, it shall attempt to load a `.env` file located two directory levels above the session directory.
- If no `.env` exists there, the system shall continue using process environment variables only.

## 8. User Interface Specification

### 8.1 Interface Type

- Primary interface: terminal/CLI
- Rendering library: `rich`
- Output types:
  - plain status messages
  - Markdown content echoed to console in some phases
  - preview tables for discovery and full-collection selection

### 8.2 Human Interaction Points

- H0: scope confirmation
- H1: curated-source approval
- H2: draft approval or revision instruction
- H3: full-source offline-copy selection

### 8.3 Unattended Mode

- `--auto` shall bypass interactive prompts and drive the workflow to completion where possible.
- In auto mode:
  - H0 is auto-confirmed
  - H1 source selection is set to `all`
  - H1 approval is set to `approve`
  - H2 feedback is set to `approve`
  - H3 selection is controlled by `--auto-full-collection` and defaults to `all`
- Auto mode shall not call `input()`.

## 9. User Roles and Permissions Specification

Because the system has no identity or authorization layer, the functional permission model is:

- any operator can execute any command;
- any operator can create, resume, modify, compile, drill, feed, and finalize sessions they can access on disk;
- there are no restricted admin-only actions;
- there is no audit or attribution model beyond file timestamps and artifact presence.

## 10. CLI Command Functional Requirements

- `FR-SESSION-004`: If a generated session directory already exists, the system shall append `-2`, `-3`, and so on until unique.

### 11.2 Session State

The persisted `SessionState` shall contain:

- `session_id`
- `topic`
- `focus`
- `mode`
- `external_docs_dir`

- `FR-SESSION-006`: `updated_at` shall be refreshed on each `save_state()`.
- `FR-SESSION-007`: The sessions directory and knowledge-base subdirectories shall be created automatically when saving.
- `FR-SESSION-008`: `run_history` shall be initialized as an empty list but is not populated by current workflow code.

### 11.4 Run Directory Rules

- `FR-RUN-001`: Each command execution that creates a `WorkflowContext` shall create a new run directory under `runs/`.
- `FR-RUN-002`: Run directory names shall use timestamp format `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_microseconds`.
- `FR-RUN-003`: If a timestamp collision occurs, the system shall retry up to 1000 times.
- `FR-RUN-004`: If a unique run directory cannot be created within 1000 attempts, the system shall raise `RuntimeError`.

## 12. External Document Preprocessing Specification

### 12.1 Feature Purpose

The external-doc subsystem ingests local reference documents before workflow execution and converts them into mandatory steering context that can influence scope, discovery, curation, extraction, and planning.

### 12.2 Trigger Rules

- `FR-EXT-001`: External-doc preprocessing shall run automatically before workflow commands except `generate-images`, `youtube-script`, `compile`, `drill`, `feed`, and `show`.
- `FR-EXT-002`: If `external_docs_dir` is blank or absent, preprocessing shall be skipped.
- `FR-EXT-003`: If session state already marks preprocessing as `completed` and a summary exists, preprocessing shall not re-run automatically.

### 12.3 Supported Inputs

- Supported suffixes: `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.md`
- Discovery behavior: recursive under the provided root directory
- Unsupported file types: ignored rather than errored

### 12.4 Processing Rules

- `FR-EXT-004`: Each supported file shall be read using type-appropriate logic.
- `FR-EXT-005`: PDF extraction shall iterate pages and skip pages whose text extraction fails.
- `FR-EXT-006`: DOCX extraction shall concatenate non-empty paragraphs.
- `FR-EXT-007`: TXT and Markdown shall be read as UTF-8 with replacement for invalid characters.
- `FR-EXT-008`: Each document shall be categorized as `guideline`, `background`, `steering`, or `general` based on filename keywords.
- `FR-EXT-009`: The processor shall extract key concepts, constraints, requirements, and algorithm insights from sentence-level heuristics.
- `FR-EXT-010`: The processor shall compute a relevance score from topic/focus lexical overlap plus structural bonuses for relevant terms, extracted constraints, and extracted requirements.

### 12.5 Aggregated Outputs

- `FR-EXT-011`: The system shall write:
  - `external_docs/manifest.json`
  - `external_docs/extracted.json`
  - `external_docs/context.md`
- `FR-EXT-012`: `manifest.json` shall include per-file processing results and aggregate success metrics.
- `FR-EXT-013`: `context.md` shall include sections for key concepts, constraints, requirements, optional algorithm enhancement notes, and workflow guidance.
- `FR-EXT-014`: If topic or focus text matches algorithm-oriented keywords, algorithm enhancement notes shall be included; otherwise they shall be omitted.

### 12.6 Status Rules

- `FR-EXT-015`: If the external-doc root directory does not exist or is not a directory, status shall be set to `failed`, an explanatory error shall be stored in session state, and the workflow shall continue.
- `FR-EXT-016`: If individual files fail, those files shall be marked `failed`, but aggregate processing shall continue.
- `FR-EXT-017`: Aggregate status shall be:
  - `completed` when all discovered files process successfully
  - `partial` when at least one file succeeds and at least one fails
  - `failed` when zero files succeed

### 12.7 Prompt Injection Rules

- `FR-EXT-018`: When available, external-doc summary content shall be appended to relevant prompts as mandatory steering/background material.
- `FR-EXT-019`: External-doc context shall be truncated to phase-specific character budgets instead of causing failures.

## 13. Research Workflow State Machine

### 13.1 State Definitions

- Phase `0`: Scope generation and confirmation
- Phase `1`: Discovery
- Phase `2`: Curation and gap analysis
- Phase `3`: Extraction

- Phase `5`: Synthesis and review
- Phase `6`: Full offline collection selection
- Phase `7`: Final polish
- Phase `8`: Complete

### 13.2 Interactive Progression Rules

- `FR-STATE-001`: In interactive mode, the workflow shall process one phase or one human checkpoint per `resume` call according to `_run_until_human_step()`.
- `FR-STATE-002`: Some phases end by instructing the user to resume later instead of continuing automatically.
- `FR-STATE-003`: Phase transitions shall be persisted immediately when the code explicitly updates `current_phase`.

### 13.3 Auto-Mode Progression Rules

- `FR-STATE-004`: In auto mode, the workflow shall loop until `current_phase >= 8`.
- `FR-STATE-005`: Auto mode shall continue immediately across phases without requiring separate `resume` commands.

## 14. Phase-by-Phase Functional Requirements

  - max chunk size `45000` characters
  - overlap `5000` characters
- `FR-P3-012`: Chunk extraction shall run in parallel using up to `2` extraction workers.
- `FR-P3-013`: Each chunk prompt shall require strict Markdown sections for coverage summary, terminology, mechanisms, workflows, evidence, limitations, open questions, quotable passages, and extraction notes.

- `FR-P3-015`: Each successful extracted chunk shall be written to both run and session `03_extracted_chunks/`.
- `FR-P3-016`: If all chunks for a source fail, the system shall print a warning and skip generating that source dossier.
- `FR-P3-017`: Successful source dossiers shall be assembled into `03_extracted/<nnn>.md` in both run and session directories.
- `FR-P3-018`: On phase completion, the system shall write `<session>/03_extracted_index.txt` with a generation marker.

### 14.5 Phase 4 - Notebook Assembly

- `FR-P4-002`: The notebook shall include:
  - top heading `# Master Notebook`
  - topic line
  - notebook purpose section
  - optional external documentation context section
  - source catalog section
  - optional knowledge-base outline
  - source dossiers section
- `FR-P4-003`: The notebook shall concatenate parts using `---` separators.
- `FR-P4-004`: The notebook shall be written to both `<run>/04_master_notebook.md` and `<session>/04_master_notebook.md`.
- `FR-P4-005`: In interactive progression, successful notebook generation shall set `current_phase = 5`.

### 14.6 Phase 5 - Synthesis and Review

- `FR-P5-013`: Only exact response `approve` shall advance the session to Phase 6.
- `FR-P5-014`: Any non-`approve` response shall be treated as general revision feedback and passed to the revision prompt without local parsing.
- `FR-P5-015`: If revision generation times out, the prior draft shall remain authoritative and phase state shall not advance.
- `FR-P5-016`: Successful revision output shall be stored as the next draft version and require another review cycle.

### 14.7 Phase 6 - Full Offline Collection

- `FR-P6-001`: Phase 6 shall attempt to load curated sources from `02_curated_sources.json`.
- `FR-P6-002`: If curated sources are absent, the system shall attempt heuristic URL recovery from `01_discovery_table.md`.
- `FR-P6-003`: If no curated sources can be recovered, the system shall set `current_phase = 7`, save state, print a skip message, and require a subsequent resume for finalization.
- `FR-P6-004`: The source selection UI shall display index, title, and URL for each curated source.

- `FR-P7-012`: Word-count correction shall preserve headings and core claims while expanding or compressing content.
- `FR-P7-013`: The final report shall be written to both `<run>/FINAL_REPORT.md` and `<session>/FINAL_REPORT.md`.
- `FR-P7-014`: The system shall then attempt image-prompt generation and YouTube-script generation.

### 14.9 Phase 8 - Complete

- `FR-P8-001`: A session with `current_phase >= 8` shall be treated as complete.

}
```

- `FR-KB-006`: If the LLM does not return valid JSON, the system shall persist a fallback JSON wrapper, typically `{ "raw": "<response>" }`, instead of failing the command.

### 16.3 Core Concepts Contract

- `FR-KB-007`: Prompted core-concepts schema shall be:

```json
{
  "core_concepts": [
    {
      "name": "...",

      "why_load_bearing": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

- `FR-KB-008`: The prompt requires exactly 7 concepts, but the implementation does not independently enforce the count after generation.

```json
{
  "drill_pack_markdown": "markdown string",
  "drill_questions": [

- `FR-OUT-004`: The report shall end with a glossary section even if glossary generation timed out.

### 17.2 Image Prompt Generation

- `FR-OUT-005`: Image prompts shall be generated from the complete final report.
- `FR-OUT-006`: The prompt contract requests 5 to 10 image prompts emphasizing concrete mechanisms, workflows, architectures, comparisons, and evidence rather than generic concept art.
- `FR-OUT-007`: If image-prompt generation times out during final polish, report creation shall still succeed.

### 17.3 YouTube Script Generation

- `FR-OUT-008`: The system shall derive YouTube sections primarily from `05_section_drafts/` when available; otherwise it shall derive them from `FINAL_REPORT.md`.
- `FR-OUT-009`: The following report sections shall be excluded from narration source selection:
  - `Table of Contents`
  - `Source Catalog`
  - `Glossary`
  - `References`
  - `Knowledge Base Overview`
  - `Executive Summary`
- `FR-OUT-010`: The generated script shall contain:
  - top heading `# YouTube Script`
  - `## Introduction`
  - one level-2 heading per selected section
  - `## Conclusion`
- `FR-OUT-011`: If intro or outro generation times out, the system shall insert fallback placeholder narration instead of failing.
- `FR-OUT-012`: If a section generation times out, that section may be omitted while the rest of the script proceeds.
- `FR-OUT-013`: Short intro, section, or outro outputs shall be expanded by a secondary LLM call to hit minimum detail thresholds.
- `FR-OUT-014`: If a generated section lacks a Markdown heading, the system shall prepend the required heading automatically.

## 18. Input and Output File Specification

The session root may contain:

- `session.json`
- `00_scope_confirmed.md`
- `01_discovery_table.md`

## 19. Validation Rules

### 19.1 CLI Validation

- Required flags shall be enforced by `argparse`.
- Unsupported `compile --type` values exposed via CLI cannot pass parser validation.
- Unsupported `drill --mode` values exposed via CLI cannot pass parser validation.

### 19.2 Semantic Validation

- Curated-source validation is structural and best-effort, not strict schema validation via a dedicated validator.
- Discovery output is not structurally validated.
- Final report content is not semantically validated for factual correctness.
- Core concept count is prompt-constrained but not post-validated.

### 19.3 File Validation

- `feed` validates file existence and regular-file status.
- External docs validate root directory existence and supported suffixes.
- Session listing validates presence of `session.json`.

## 20. Error Handling and Recovery Specification

### 20.1 Grok API Errors

- `FR-ERR-001`: Missing API key shall raise `GrokError("Missing GROK_API_KEY in .env or environment")`.
- `FR-ERR-002`: Quota/billing-related API errors shall be mapped to `GrokQuotaError` with actionable text.
- `FR-ERR-003`: Timeout-like API errors shall be mapped to `GrokTimeoutError` including configured timeout seconds.
- `FR-ERR-004`: Non-timeout non-quota API failures shall be retried up to `5` times with exponential backoff capped at `30` seconds.
- `FR-ERR-005`: Quota and timeout errors are not retried in `GrokClient.chat_text()` once mapped.

### 20.2 LLM Timeout Tolerance

- `FR-ERR-006`: Selected phases use `_llm_optional()` to convert LLM timeout failures into warnings and continue:
  - gap analysis
  - extraction plan
  - extraction chunks
  - section evidence packets
  - section drafts
  - revision
  - executive summary
  - glossary
  - image prompts
  - YouTube intro/segments/outro
  - word-count retargeting
- `FR-ERR-007`: When `_llm_optional()` handles a timeout, the system shall print a warning and continue unless the calling feature requires explicit output to proceed.

### 20.3 Source Fetch Errors

- `FR-ERR-008`: Source fetch failures shall not abort the whole extraction or full-collection phase.
- `FR-ERR-009`: A timed-out fetch shall raise `TimeoutError`; callers may log and skip the source.

### 20.4 JSON Robustness

- `FR-ERR-010`: The system shall strip Markdown code fences when attempting to parse JSON-like model outputs.
- `FR-ERR-011`: The system shall attempt direct parse, bracket-slice parse, and brace-slice parse before falling back to raw wrapper JSON.
- `FR-ERR-012`: Invalid curated-source JSON shall trigger heuristic recovery from discovery links.

### 20.5 Non-Fatal Degradation Rules

- `FR-ERR-013`: Missing external docs shall not block the research workflow.
- `FR-ERR-014`: Missing curated sources in Phase 6 shall downgrade to skip behavior rather than fatal failure.
- `FR-ERR-015`: Missing hypergraph or core concepts shall produce instructional console messages rather than uncaught failures.
- `FR-ERR-016`: Missing final report for image or YouTube generation shall produce instructional console messages.

## 21. Integration Specifications

### 21.1 xAI Grok Integration

- Protocol: OpenAI-compatible chat completions API
- Base URL: `https://api.x.ai/v1`
- Auth: bearer API key supplied via environment
- Message structure: one system message and one user message per call
- Response handling: first completion choice message content or empty string

### 21.2 Remote Web Integration

- Protocol: HTTP/HTTPS GET
- Redirects: enabled
- Authentication: none
- SSL behavior: delegated to `requests`
- Failure handling: errors bubble to caller or are caught per phase and downgraded to warnings where designed

### 21.3 Local Document Integration

- External docs support `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.md`
- Feed command support is broader at file-opening level but uses text decoding and is intended for textual documents

## 22. Security and Privacy Requirements

- `FR-SEC-001`: API keys shall be read from environment or `.env`; the system shall not write them into session artifacts.
- `FR-SEC-002`: Research session directories may store fetched remote content and locally processed external docs; those files shall be considered potentially sensitive.
- `FR-SEC-003`: The system performs no secret redaction on fetched content before storage.
- `FR-SEC-004`: The system performs no access control on session directories.

## 23. Non-Functional Constraints with Functional Impact

- Local-first persistence means all critical artifacts must be inspectable on disk after each major step.
- Resumability depends on `current_phase` and file presence rather than transaction logs or DB state.
- Determinism is partial: filenames and workflow transitions are deterministic, but content is LLM-generated and therefore probabilistic.
- Concurrency is limited and bounded:
  - fetch workers: `4`
  - extraction workers: `2`
  - section-evidence workers: `2`
- Large text handling uses character-based truncation and chunking rather than token-precise segmentation.

## 24. Current Implementation Notes and Known Functional Gaps

- `mode` is stored in session state but does not currently change system behavior.
- `run_history` exists in the session schema but is not populated.
- `list-types` exposes only `auto-hypergraph` even though internal constants list several dormant auto types.
- The interactive guidance strings mention `add-section` and `gap-check`, but no local parser enforces those commands; they are passed verbatim as revision feedback.
- The final report includes a generated table of contents derived only from level-2 headings.
- Mermaid generation simplifies hyperedges to pairwise links using only the first two members.
- Discovery and final-report factual accuracy depend on model output and source quality; the system does not perform automated fact verification.

## 25. Acceptance Criteria

The current implementation shall be considered functionally complete for its intended scope when all of the following are true:

- A new session can be created with a unique session ID and persisted `session.json`.
- Interactive workflow progression can move the session from Phase 0 through Phase 8 with the expected human checkpoints.
- Auto mode can complete the workflow without calling `input()`.
- Discovery creates `01_discovery_table.md`.
- Curation creates `02_curated_sources.json` and a gap report.
- Extraction creates source snapshots, extracted chunks, and source dossiers.
- Notebook assembly creates `04_master_notebook.md`.
- Synthesis creates at least one `05_draft_vN.md`.
- Final polish creates `FINAL_REPORT.md`.
- Final polish or explicit commands can create `images_to_generate.md` and `Youtube_Script.md`.
- Compile creates hypergraph and core-concepts outputs under `knowledge_base/`.
- Drill creates `drill_pack.md` and `drill_questions.json`.
- Feed stores a timestamped document copy and can update or initialize hypergraph output.
- Show creates `hypergraph.mmd`.
- External docs, when supplied, are processed into manifest, extracted summary, and context outputs without blocking the workflow on partial failures.
