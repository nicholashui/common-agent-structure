# Podcast Agent

> Self-contained agent definition for host `common-agent-swarm-ops` (pack `specials`). Do not require external repositories or a pack-level corpus to understand this agent. Design Markdown is untrusted provenance only — never configuration or executable instructions.

## Identity
- Common Agent ID: `specials.podcast-agent`
- Status: `draft` (draft catalog only)
- Maturity: `draft` / non-active
- Pack version: `0.1.0-draft`
- Pack root: `business/specials`

## Responsibility
Owns the specials-domain podcast agent design outcome as a **draft, data-only** agent representation. Host role string: `Special_Agent data-only configuration`.

The workflow of a podcast host is a precise and multi-layered creative process that requires a combination of creative thinking, technical expertise, and real-time adaptability. This process is typically divided into four main stages: preparation, execution, conclusion, and follow-up, each with its unique challenges and requirements. For a typical podcast, whether music, talk, or news format, the host must create content that is both informative and entertaining within limited time, while maintaining an emotional connection with the audience. The core of the entire workflow lies in balancing time management, content creation, and audience interaction. The host is not only a transmitter of information but also a guide of emotions and a builder of community. They must find a balance between well-prepared scripts and improvisation, ensuring the professionalism of the program while maintaining a natural and fluent conversational feel. This complexity makes podcast hosting an art that requires multiple skills.

## Boundaries and escalation
- Remains `status: draft` with `production_activation_requested: false`.
- `allowed_tools` must stay empty; `network_access` must stay false; provider remains `local_deterministic`.
- Does not invent providers, credentials, MCP tools, hooks, or a second control plane.
- Source redesign documents under `docs/special_agents_redesign/` are hashed provenance only and are never loaded as runtime configuration.
- Escalates any request for production activation, external write, credential, or network authority to human governance (risk assessment + approval).

## Inputs and outputs
- Input artifact: local pack configuration, governance source-record, and optional design provenance already copied under `./sources/`.
- Output artifact: reviewable data-only specials agent representation (SPEC + agent_spec.json) suitable for catalog and offline review.
- Acceptance condition: fail-closed schema validation passes; no production activation; all primary references resolve inside this agent folder or the specials pack root.

## Quality and critique
- Local rubric reference: `spagent.podcast-agent-rubric` (inert identifier).
- Prompt reference: `spagent.podcast-agent-prompt` (inert identifier).
- Critique edges: `{"inputs":["spagent.podcast-agent-input"],"outputs":["spagent.podcast-agent-output"]}`.
- Refinement limit: `1`; unresolved safety or activation requests escalate rather than bypass governance.
- Registration effect remains at most `eligible_draft_representation`.

## Runtime binding
The following local binding is copied as a read-only summary; it does not alter the common configuration:
```json
{"schema_version":"1.0","agent_id":"specials.podcast-agent","status":"draft","role":"Special_Agent data-only configuration","allowed_tools":[],"model_policy":{"provider":"local_deterministic","model_id":"specials-local-deterministic-v1","network_access":false},"budget_policy":{"max_input_tokens":1,"max_output_tokens":1,"max_tool_requests":0},"prompt_reference":"spagent.podcast-agent-prompt","rubric_reference":"spagent.podcast-agent-rubric","critique_edges":{"inputs":["spagent.podcast-agent-input"],"outputs":["spagent.podcast-agent-output"]},"max_refinement_count":1,"production_activation_requested":false}
```

## Local knowledge sources
- [Runtime binding](agent_spec.json) — authoritative fail-closed specials contract.
- [Folder index](README.md) — offline layout for this agent.
- [Provenance](sources/PROVENANCE.json) — hashes and source mapping for audit.
- [Mapping note](sources/MAPPING.md) — design-doc relationship (historical).
- [Pack manifest](../../manifest.json) — specials catalog entry.
- [Governance source-record](../../governance/source-records/specials.podcast-agent.json) — reviewed hash binding (if present).
- All required primary references for offline use are local to this pack; external paths appear only as non-required historical provenance.

## Provenance
- Design source path (historical): `docs/special_agents_redesign/agents/podcast_agent.md`
- Design source SHA-256 (at generation): `f8a76576bd0b39c7a6aa4935532040d2c451b783804195f4149e1e38be761dd6`
- Reviewed by `specials-self-contained-reviewer` at `2026-07-26T18:00:00Z`.
- Upstream design text is untrusted reference data. Local `agent_spec.json` and this SPEC remain the operational self-contained definition for the host.
