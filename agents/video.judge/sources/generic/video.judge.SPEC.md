## Responsibility

Adjudicates disputes via multi-agent debate; scores against rubric

## Knowledge distillation sources

Du 2023 (LLM debate); MT-Bench rubrics; guild scoring sheets

## Self-quality criteria

Inter-rater κ vs expert panel ≥0.8

## Surpass-human signal

Higher κ than median human juror

## Critique bus

- **Accepts critique from:** HiTL on overturned rulings

- **Comments on:** DirectorAgent, ScreenwriterAgent, any disputing pair

## Tools (design-time documentation)

MT-Bench/Arena evaluation harness; rubric template engine

**Runtime safety:** Host allow-lists are only `agent_spec.json` + `tool-permission-register.json`. CI uses video_* stubs. Do not treat design-time vendor names as enabled APIs.

## Architecture pattern

Multi-agent debate (Du 2023) + LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023)

## Common structure of an AI agent (full §11 from agents.md)

## 11. Common Structure of an AI Agent

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

### 11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

### 11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |
| 13 | **Critique Outbox** | Peer agents whose work this agent is qualified to review | Defined per-agent in roster. Messages emitted on same bus. Evidence-backed, rubric-referenced, appended to C2PA provenance. |
| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

**Target Audience:** Senior AI Engineering / Coding Agents (for immediate implementation)
**Purpose:** This is the **definitive, production-grade specification** for building the **Aesthetics Agent** — a stateful, multimodal evaluation-and-alignment service that operationalizes a simulated **"artiste sense"** (artistic/aesthetic intuition) for the entire VA-Agent-Swarm. It is the deep rethink of [`aesthetics_agents.md`](./aesthetics_agents.md): where that document is a *survey of methods*, this is a *buildable agent contract*. It reframes "teach AI artistic sense" from a single image scorer into a **shared aesthetic nervous system** — a critic that every generative agent consults, a reward signal that every fine-tuning loop trusts, and a personalization engine that carries a director's, brand's, or artist's taste across the whole pipeline.

---

### 1. Executive Summary

The **Aesthetics Agent** is the swarm's computational embodiment of "artiste sense." It does not *replace* human taste — it **amplifies, encodes, and propagates** it at superhuman speed across 114 agents.

It serves three distinct, composable functions:

1. **The Critic (Perceive).** A multimodal, multi-head evaluator that scores any visual artifact — single frame, image, or full video clip — against a decomposed aesthetic rubric (composition, color harmony, lighting, depth, emotional resonance, technical quality, style fidelity, novelty). This is the swarm's shared "eye."
2. **The Aligner (Refine).** A preference-and-reward service that turns the Critic's judgments into actionable feedback and training signal — driving self-refinement loops, preference optimization (DPO/RLHF/RLAIF), and prompt steering for `PromptEngineerAgent`, `CinematographerAgent`, `ColoristAgent`, and peers.
3. **The Taste-Keeper (Personalize).** A profile store that captures *whose* aesthetic governs a project — a director's lookbook, a brand's guidelines, an artist's portfolio, an audience cohort's preferences — and conditions all scoring and alignment on that profile.

**Why this is a "deep rethink" and not a wrapper:**

| The naive guide says... | The Aesthetics Agent does... |
|---|---|
| "Train an aesthetic scorer (e.g., NIMA, LAION)." | Treats a single scalar score as *insufficient and dangerous*. Decomposes aesthetics into auditable sub-attributes + a temporal track for video, with calibrated uncertainty. |
| "Use the critic as a reward to fine-tune the generator." | Wraps every reward use in **anti-reward-hacking** guardrails (reward variance monitoring, ensemble disagreement, OOD detection, KL anchoring). |
| "Personalize on one artist's ratings." | Makes taste a **first-class, versioned, consent-governed profile** that flows through the swarm's handoff contract and critique bus. |
| Operates on still images. | Is **video-native first**: temporal coherence, motion aesthetics, cut rhythm, and per-shot-vs-sequence scoring. |
| Aesthetic sense = beauty prediction. | Aesthetic sense = beauty **+ intent fidelity + emotional target + brand/style fit + novelty**, gated so high scores never come from generic "pretty slop." |

The result is a single agent that other agents *cannot do their job without*: it is referenced by `agents.md` entries #6, #10, #14, #15, #16, #39, #46, #49 and others as "aesthetic regressor / CLIP-based aesthetic scoring," and this document is its authoritative definition.

### 2. Background: From "Artiste Sense" to Computational Aesthetics

The source document [`aesthetics_agents.md`](./aesthetics_agents.md) defines **"artiste sense"** as the intuitive, perceptual, and expressive sensitivity artists develop — an "eye" for composition, color harmony, rhythm, proportion, light/shadow, depth, and emotional resonance; a structural (3D) way of seeing; a psychological drive to express; and a grounded, iterative creative practice.

Its central thesis, which this spec adopts wholesale:

> AI cannot possess *genuine* lived artistic sense (no consciousness, no emotion), but it can develop a **sophisticated simulated version** through (a) data-driven evaluators trained on human aesthetic judgments, (b) preference-alignment feedback loops, and (c) computational-creativity extensions. The strongest results come from **human–AI symbiosis**, not autonomous AI artists.

This specification accepts that framing as ground truth and answers the only question the survey left open: **what is the precise, implementable agent contract that delivers it inside a 114-agent video production system?**

---

### 3. The Deep Rethink — Five Reframings

The act of "deeply rethinking" the guide produced five architectural commitments. Each is a deliberate departure from the naive "train a scorer" recipe.

**3.1 Aesthetics is a vector, not a scalar.**
A single 1–10 score is unaccountable and trivially reward-hacked. The Critic emits a **decomposed AestheticVector** — independent heads for composition, color, light, depth, subject treatment, technical quality, emotional resonance, style fidelity, and novelty — each with a calibrated confidence. The scalar is a *gated aggregation*, never the source of truth.

**3.2 Aesthetics is temporal.**
This is a video swarm. A montage of individually beautiful frames can be aesthetically incoherent. The Critic scores both **per-frame** and **per-sequence**: motion smoothness, temporal color/exposure stability, cut rhythm vs. genre prior, and "does the clip read as one authored gesture."

**3.3 Aesthetics is whose.**
Following the LAION-Aesthetics audit critique that a "one-size-fits-all" beauty model encodes a narrow, unexamined taste ([arXiv:2601.09896](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.09896v1)), the agent refuses to pretend there is one universal beauty. Every score is conditioned on an explicit **AestheticProfile** (director / brand / artist / audience cohort / "neutral baseline"). Personalization is the default, not an add-on. Recent work shows LLM-interview-elicited personalized aesthetic models can exceed generic ones at predicting an individual's judgments ([arXiv:2605.14761](https://arxiv.org/html/2605.14761v1)).

**3.4 Aesthetics must not be hackable.**
The moment the Critic becomes a reward, generators learn to exploit it (high-frequency texture spam, saturation blowouts, "AI-glossy" sheen). The Aligner therefore ships with first-class **anti-reward-hacking** machinery — ensemble disagreement, reward-variance monitoring (large/diverse reward models retain high variance and resist collapse, per [arXiv:2509.08826](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.08826v1)), KL anchoring to a reference model, OOD artifact detectors, and inference-time mitigation ([arXiv:2510.01549](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01549)). Rich, rationale-bearing preferences are favored over opaque scalars ([arXiv:2503.11720](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.11720)).

**3.5 Aesthetics is gated by intent.**
Beauty divorced from the brief is noise. The aggregate quality is multiplied by **intent fidelity** (does it match the shot intent / prompt / brand?) and **emotional-target match** (does it land the intended valence/arousal?). A gorgeous image that ignores the director's intent scores low. This mirrors the value-gated selection in the [General Creative Agent](./general_creative_agent_functional_specification.md) (SSOR).

---

### 4. Formal Aesthetic Model

Let an artifact \( x \) (image or video clip) be evaluated under an aesthetic profile \( p \), an intent/brief \( b \), and an emotional target \( e \).

The Critic produces a **decomposed aesthetic vector**:

\[
\mathbf{A}(x \mid p) = \bigl[\, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k \,\bigr], \quad a_i \in [0,1], \; \text{with confidence } \sigma_i
\]

over \( k \) sub-attributes (the **Aesthetic Dimensions**, §6). The **gated aesthetic quality** is:

\[
\operatorname{AQ}(x \mid p,b,e) \;=\; \underbrace{G\!\left(\mathbf{A}(x\mid p), \mathbf{w}_p\right)}_{\text{profiled aggregate}} \;\cdot\; \underbrace{I(x,b)}_{\text{intent fidelity}} \;\cdot\; \underbrace{E(x,e)}_{\text{emotion match}} \;\cdot\; \underbrace{\big(1 - H(x)\big)}_{\text{anti-hack penalty}}
\]

Where:
- \( G(\cdot, \mathbf{w}_p) \): profile-weighted aggregation of the attribute vector (weights \( \mathbf{w}_p \) come from the active `AestheticProfile`; a brand may weight color/brand-fit heavily, a horror DoP may weight light/contrast).
- \( I(x,b) \in [0,1] \): intent fidelity (e.g., CLIP-T / VLM grounding of artifact against shot-intent text or reference; target ≥ 0.32 per `DirectorAgent` rubric in `agents.md`).
- \( E(x,e) \in [0,1] \): emotional-target match (valence/arousal regression vs. target, shared with `ComposerAgent` emotional-arc validator).
- \( H(x) \in [0,1] \): hack/artifact likelihood (OOD score, ensemble disagreement, artifact detector) — high \( H \) collapses the score regardless of surface prettiness.

For video, AQ is computed per-frame **and** at sequence level, then combined:

\[
\operatorname{AQ}_{\text{clip}} = \alpha \cdot \operatorname{mean}_t \operatorname{AQ}(x_t) \;+\; \beta \cdot \operatorname{AQ}_{\text{temporal}}(x_{1:T}) \;-\; \gamma \cdot \operatorname{Var}_t\!\big[\text{exposure, color, identity}\big]
\]

penalizing temporal instability (flicker, color drift, identity break — overlaps with `AIQAConsistencyAgent` #49).

**Hard principles (encoded in code):**
- **No naked scalar.** Any consumer requesting only `AQ` also receives \( \mathbf{A} \), \( H \), and the top failing dimension.
- **Uncertainty travels.** Every score ships with confidence; low-confidence scores must escalate to HiTL or a second model, never silently pass.
- **Profile-or-refuse.** If no profile is supplied, the agent uses an explicitly labeled `neutral_baseline_v{n}` profile and flags that the result is taste-agnostic.

---

### 5. Architecture

The Aesthetics Agent is a three-subsystem service sharing one profile store and one model registry.

**5.1 The Critic (Perceive).** Ensemble of complementary backbones:
- A fast **regression head** on a vision backbone (SigLIP / CLIP-ViT) — Aesthetic-Predictor-V2.5-style MLP for cheap first-pass screening at scale.
- A **VLM critic** (Grok-4.x vision, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o-vision) producing fine-grained, attribute-level natural-language critique + scores — the "explainable eye."
- Specialized detectors: artifact/hand/face-distortion detectors, ΔE color drift, exposure histogram/zone analysis, rule-of-thirds & leading-lines geometry, FID/FVD against style reference, temporal smoothness (optical flow), VBench-style video metrics.

**5.2 The Aligner (Refine).** Converts verdicts into action:
- **Self-refine feedback**: a prioritized, machine-readable critique ("scene 3 underexposed in zone IV; subject collides with right edge; color drifts +6 ΔE across cut").
- **Reward signal**: scalar/vector reward for RLHF / RLAIF / DPO / ReFL-style diffusion fine-tuning, always emitted with variance + ensemble-agreement metadata.
- **Preference pairs**: for DPO-style training, with rationale (rich preferences) not just A≻B.
- **Prompt-steer hints**: concrete prompt deltas handed to `PromptEngineerAgent` (#46) to reach target in ≤3 iterations.

**5.3 The Taste-Keeper (Personalize).** Versioned, consent-governed `AestheticProfile` store (see §10), elicited via portfolio ingestion, pairwise preference collection, and LLM-interview elicitation ([arXiv:2605.14761](https://arxiv.org/html/2605.14761v1)).

**5.4 Anti-Hack Guardrails.** Cross-cutting safety layer wrapping every reward emission (see §11).

### 6. Aesthetic Dimensions (the Decomposed Rubric)

The Critic emits a score + confidence for each dimension. Profiles re-weight them; they are *never* collapsed before being logged.

| # | Dimension | What it measures | Primary signal |
|---|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| D1 | **Composition** | Balance, rule-of-thirds, leading lines, negative space, framing, staging clarity | Geometry detector + VLM |
| D2 | **Color Harmony** | Palette coherence, contrast, temperature consistency, mood vector | Color histogram, ΔE, palette extraction |
| D3 | **Light & Shadow** | Exposure zones, key/fill ratio, direction, dynamic range, mood | Histogram/zone analysis, VLM |
| D4 | **Depth & Form** | 3D readability, layering, focal depth, structural "seeing" (per artiste-sense) | Depth estimation + VLM |
| D5 | **Subject Treatment** | Subject prominence, gaze, gesture, silhouette readability | Saliency + pose/landmark |
| D6 | **Technical Quality** | Sharpness, noise, banding, artifacts, resolution adequacy | Detectors + IQA model |
| D7 | **Emotional Resonance** | Evoked valence/arousal vs. target | Affect regressor (shared w/ ComposerAgent) |
| D8 | **Style Fidelity** | Adherence to style bible / lookbook / brand | CLIP/embedding distance to reference set |
| D9 | **Novelty / Distinctiveness** | Originality vs. "generic AI slop"; inverted-U (not maximal) | Embedding rarity vs. corpus |
| D10 | **Temporal Aesthetics** *(video)* | Motion smoothness, cut rhythm, temporal stability, "one authored gesture" | Optical flow, VBench-style, beat-sync |

**Novelty note (D9):** Following the SSOR inverted-U principle from the GCA spec, novelty is rewarded in a *moderate* band — too low = cliché/derivative; too high = incoherent. This is what prevents the agent from rewarding bland, statistically-average "pretty" output.

### 7. Functional Requirements

**7.1 Input (JSON).**
```json

  "budget": { "max_latency_ms": 800, "tier": "fast | deep" }
}
```

**7.2 Output — `AestheticVerdict` (JSON + Markdown).**
```json
{
  "artifact_ref": "asset_id_v2",
  "profile_id": "director_lynchian_v3",
  "aesthetic_vector": { "composition": 0.81, "color_harmony": 0.74, "light": 0.62,
                        "depth": 0.70, "subject": 0.88, "technical": 0.91,
                        "emotion": 0.66, "style_fidelity": 0.79, "novelty": 0.55,

  "hack_likelihood": 0.04,
  "aesthetic_quality": 0.73,
  "top_failing_dimensions": ["light", "novelty"],
  "actionable_critique": [
    "Underexposed in zone IV; lift key +1/3 stop on subject left.",

  ],
  "prompt_steer_hints": ["add 'low-key chiaroscuro, single practical source'"],
  "uncertainty_flag": false,
  "escalate_to_hitl": false,
  "provenance": { "models": ["aesV2.5","grok-vision-4.x"], "ensemble_agreement": 0.86 }
}
```

**7.3 Modes.**
- `screen` — fast scalar gate for high-volume candidate culling (regression head only).
- `score` — full decomposed vector + verdict.
- `align` — emit reward/preference signal for a training/refinement loop.
- `compare` — pairwise/listwise ranking of N candidates (for "choose the best take").
- `refine` — generate → score → critique → suggest, iterated (mimics the artist's iterative loop).

**7.4 Statefulness.** Per-project memory of accepted/rejected artifacts ratchets the profile and feeds Reflexion-style episodic memory (consistent with swarm principle "Continuous Self-Improvement").

**7.5 Non-functional.** Fast-tier screening ≤ 800 ms/artifact; deep-tier ≤ 8 s; horizontal GPU autoscale; deterministic given fixed profile + model versions (reproducibility for audits).

---

### 8. Integration with the VA-Agent-Swarm

This agent is **cross-cutting infrastructure**, registered alongside the Research Agent, GCA, and Optimization Agent in [`SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md`](./SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md) §4.

**8.1 Consumers (who calls it and why).**

| Agent (from `agents.md`) | Use of Aesthetics Agent |
|---|---|
| #6 CinematographerAgent (DoP) | Replaces ad-hoc "CLIP-based aesthetic scoring" — composition/light/color self-refine rubric |
| #10 ColoristAgent | ΔE drift, mood-vector match, palette coherence scoring |
| #14 StoryboardAgent / #15 ConceptArtistAgent / #16 ProductionDesignAgent | Style-bible adherence + composition scoring |
| #39 FoodStylistAgent / #40 TravelCineAgent / #45 RealEstatePhotoAgent | The shared "aesthetic regressor" these specs reference |
| #46 PromptEngineerAgent | `refine` mode + `prompt_steer_hints` to hit target in ≤3 iterations |
| #49 AIQAConsistencyAgent | Temporal stability / artifact (`hack_likelihood`) cross-check |
| #1 DirectorAgent / #56 JudgeAgent | Tie-break and blind-preference adjudication on candidate takes |
| Delivery & Marketing (#27, #28, #31) | Thumbnail/hook aesthetic scoring for predicted engagement |

**8.2 Critique Bus.** Verdicts are published on the swarm's structured critique bus (`SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md` §7.1) with `critique_type: "aesthetic_feedback"`, `severity`, `rubric_score`, and `artifact_ref`, so any agent can react asynchronously.

**8.3 Handoff Contract.** The `AestheticVerdict` is attached to the artifact's `qc_status` field in the **Shared Artifact Handoff Contract** (`SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md` §7), making aesthetic state travel with provenance through every phase.

**8.4 Relationship to neighbors.**
- **vs. GCA (creativity):** GCA *generates* novel-yet-useful candidates; Aesthetics Agent *judges and refines* them. GCA's novelty score (D9) is supplied by this agent. They form a generate↔evaluate loop.
- **vs. AIQAConsistencyAgent (#49):** AIQA catches *errors* (drift, broken hands, identity breaks); Aesthetics Agent judges *taste*. `hack_likelihood` is the shared boundary — co-trained, deduplicated.
- **vs. Psychological Recommendation / AudienceSim:** those predict *audience* preference; Aesthetics Agent encodes *authorial/brand* taste. A profile can be an audience-cohort profile, bridging the two.

---

### 9. The Three Operating Loops

**9.1 Critic Loop (evaluate).** `artifact → ensemble score → decompose → gate by intent/emotion → anti-hack check → AestheticVerdict`.

**9.2 Alignment Loop (teach the generator).** Mirrors the source guide's pipeline, hardened:
1. Generate N candidates (base model).
2. `compare` mode ranks them; `score` mode decomposes.
3. Human raters spot-check a sampled subset (symbiosis, not full autonomy).
4. Build **rich preference pairs** (with rationale) → DPO / RLHF / RLAIF / ReFL update.
5. Monitor reward variance & ensemble agreement; if variance collapses → suspect hacking, freeze, escalate.
6. Repeat; generator internalizes the taste and "instinctively" picks stronger outputs.

**9.3 Personalization Loop (capture whose taste).**
1. Ingest portfolio / lookbook / brand guide → seed embedding profile.
2. Collect pairwise preferences and/or run **LLM-interview elicitation** to surface latent criteria.
3. Fit profile weights \( \mathbf{w}_p \); validate against held-out judgments.
4. Version, sign, and store; expose `profile_id` to the swarm.

---

### 10. Personalization: the `AestheticProfile`

A first-class, versioned, consent-governed object.

```json
{
  "profile_id": "director_lynchian_v3",
  "owner": "consenting_entity_id",
  "consent": { "scope": "project_x", "expires": "2027-01-01", "c2pa_signed": true },
  "weights": { "light": 0.22, "color_harmony": 0.18, "novelty": 0.15, "...": "..." },
  "exemplars": ["asset_uri_1", "..."],
  "anti_exemplars": ["asset_uri_9", "..."],
  "elicited_criteria": ["prefers low-key contrast", "avoids saturated reds", "..."],
  "embedding_centroid": "vec://...",
  "version": 3,
  "lineage": ["v1","v2","v3"]
}
```

Profile types: **Director**, **Brand**, **Artist**, **Audience-Cohort** (links to [Psychological Recommendation](./psychological_recommendation_agent_functional_specification.md)), **Genre-prior**, **Neutral-baseline**. Profiles are composable (e.g., `brand_acme ⊕ genre_noir`) with documented precedence.

**Governance:** Personalizing on a named human's taste/portfolio requires consent recorded in the profile and cleared by `ComplianceAgent` (#37) — same rigor as voice/likeness cloning.

---

### 11. Reward Hacking, Failure Modes & Defenses

The single greatest risk: when the Critic becomes a reward, generators learn to *fool the eye*, not *please it*.

| Failure mode | Symptom | Defense |
|---|---|---|
| **Texture/detail spam** | High score, busy high-frequency noise | Artifact detector; frequency-domain sanity check; human spot-check |
| **Saturation/contrast blowout** | "AI-glossy" oversaturated look | ΔE & gamut bounds; per-dimension caps; brand profile constraints |
| **Mode collapse** | All outputs converge to one "safe" look | Reward-variance monitoring; large/diverse reward ensembles retain variance ([arXiv:2509.08826](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.08826v1)) |
| **Off-distribution exploitation** | Score high on inputs unlike training data | OOD detector → force `escalate_to_hitl`, never auto-pass |
| **Intent drift** | Beautiful but ignores brief | Intent-fidelity gate \( I(x,b) \) multiplies AQ |
| **Opaque-scalar overfit** | Generator games one number | Rich, rationale-bearing preferences ([arXiv:2503.11720](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.11720)); decomposed vector never collapsed |
| **Taste monoculture / bias** | One narrow aesthetic encoded as "universal" | Mandatory explicit profiles; bias audit per LAION critique ([arXiv:2601.09896](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.09896v1)) |

**Core mechanisms:** (1) **Ensemble disagreement** — regression head, VLM critic, and detectors must agree; high disagreement raises \( H(x) \) and triggers HiTL. (2) **KL anchoring** to a reference generator during alignment to prevent runaway exploitation. (3) **Inference-time mitigation** for alignment without full fine-tuning ([arXiv:2510.01549](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01549)). (4) **Held-out human eval** as the non-negotiable ground truth — the agent's correlation with human raters is itself continuously monitored and is a release gate.

---

### 12. Technical Architecture & Implementation Guidelines

- **Core classes:** `AestheticCritic`, `AttributeHead[]`, `EnsembleScorer`, `IntentGate`, `EmotionGate`, `AntiHackGuard`, `Aligner`, `PreferenceBuilder`, `TasteKeeper`, `AestheticProfile`, `AestheticsAgent` (facade).
- **Models:** SigLIP/CLIP-ViT backbone + MLP regression head (fast tier, Aesthetic-Predictor-V2.5 lineage); VLM critic via swarm LLM providers (Grok-4.x vision / Gemini 2.5 Pro / GPT-4o); detector zoo (artifact, ΔE, depth, flow, FID/FVD, VBench-style).
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch + `diffusers` (for ReFL/DPO hooks); LangGraph node for orchestration; FastAPI service; Redis Streams for critique-bus publication.
- **Stores:** vector DB (Chroma/Pinecone) for exemplars & embeddings; profile DB (versioned, signed); episodic memory for refine-loop learning.
- **Provenance:** every verdict logs model versions, ensemble agreement, profile version → C2PA-aligned audit trail.
- **Deliverables:** repo skeleton, `AestheticVerdict` schema, profile schema, example notebooks (image scoring, video scoring, DPO alignment loop, profile elicitation), integration adapters for #6/#10/#46/#49.

### 13. Evaluation & Success Criteria

| Criterion | Target |
|---|---|
| Correlation with human aesthetic ratings (held-out) | Spearman ρ ≥ 0.75 on benchmark; ≥ 0.85 on personalized profile |
| Personalized > generic | Profiled model beats `neutral_baseline` at predicting owner's pairwise choices (per [arXiv:2605.14761](https://arxiv.org/html/2605.14761v1)) |
| Blind preference (downstream) | Outputs aligned via this agent win ≥ 55% blind pairwise vs. unaligned (Arena-style) |
| Reward-hacking resistance | Reward variance maintained; mode-collapse rate below threshold over a fine-tuning run |
| Anti-hack recall | ≥ 95% of human-flagged "fooled-the-eye" cases caught by `hack_likelihood` |
| Latency | Fast tier ≤ 800 ms; deep tier ≤ 8 s |
| Calibration | Confidence well-calibrated (ECE below threshold); low-confidence reliably escalates |
| Traceability | 100% of verdicts carry decomposed vector + provenance |

---

### 14. Limitations & Future Directions

- **No genuine lived aesthetic.** The agent's "sense" is statistical and derivative; it has no spontaneity or personal impulse. It is an *amplifier* of human taste — best used in symbiosis, with HiTL on novel or low-confidence judgments.
- **Taste is contested.** Even with explicit profiles, the corpus and rater pool carry bias; the agent surfaces *whose* taste it encodes rather than claiming universality.
- **Reward hacking is an arms race.** Defenses reduce, not eliminate, exploitation; held-out human eval remains the ground truth and release gate.
- **Future:** larger multimodal critics; brain-activity / biosignal proxies for emotional resonance; embodied/3D structural "seeing"; tighter artist co-training loops; cross-modal aesthetics (image↔music↔motion) shared with `ComposerAgent` and `ChoreographyAgent`.

# Refined Agent Loop: Hierarchical, ReAct-Inspired, Production-Grade Design

**Version:** 2026-06-10 (v3 — Cognitive-Enhanced: Integrated high-priority traditional human thinking models from ranked analysis in thinking_model.md (Cynefin, Premortem, AAR, Double-Loop Learning, RPD, Dual Process, Metacognition, 5 Whys/Fishbone, Red Team, Paul-Elder, etc.) for adaptive context routing, proactive risk mitigation, fast/slow deliberation paths, structured reflection, and deeper self-evolution. All v2 details preserved; new mechanisms are additive, configurable, and mapped to existing phases.)  
**Research Sources**: "Why Do Multi-Agent LLM Systems Fail?" (MASFT taxonomy, 14-18 failure modes), Reflexion, Prospector, CGI, memory papers, xAI docs, developer reports on infinite loops/context issues, plus systematic review of 40+ human cognitive frameworks (ranked by adoption priority for agent loops).
**Purpose:** Actionable reference for building reliable, scalable LLM-based agent systems. Combines academic foundations (ReAct synergy of reasoning + acting), xAI's server-side agentic implementation (multi-agent orchestration for deep research), and advanced hierarchical patterns (planner + specialists + self-evolution).  
**Target Audience:** Builders of harnesses, multi-agent systems, coding agents, research agents (e.g., N1ch01as-style Architect with critic/self-refinement loops).  
**Key Principle:** Controlled loops with explicit state, structured outputs, quality gates, and hierarchical delegation. Not uncontrolled chain reactions — managed orchestration with bubbling-up consolidation and deliberate synthesis.

## 1. Core Principles (Refined from Research)

### 1.1 Foundational: ReAct Paradigm (Yao et al., ICLR 2023)
- **Definition**: Interleave **verbal reasoning traces (Thoughts)** with **actions** (tool calls, environment interactions, or delegation). Observations from actions ground and update reasoning.
- **Why it works**:
  - Pure Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Static, prone to hallucinations and error propagation (no external grounding).
  - Pure Acting: No high-level planning, poor exception handling, inefficient trajectories.
  - **ReAct synergy**: Thoughts decompose goals, track progress, handle exceptions, and replan. Actions provide real observations that correct reasoning and enable adaptation. Results in 10-34% gains on interactive tasks and reduced hallucinations on knowledge tasks.
- **Basic Cycle** (one iteration):
  1. **Thought**: LLM reasons about current state, goal, progress, next step, or exception. (Internal, updates context.)
  2. **Action**: Decide and output executable step (tool call with args, sub-agent delegation, or `Finish`/`Done`).
  3. **Observation**: Environment / tool / sub-agent returns structured result (data + metadata: status, confidence, summary, issues).
  4. Append to history/state → repeat.
- **Prompt Structure** (few-shot examples essential): Dense thoughts for reasoning-heavy tasks (QA/research); sparser for embodied/decision tasks. Use explicit tags or JSON schema for parseability.
- **Exception Handling**: Thought step detects failure ("Nothing useful returned") → replans or adjusts action in next iteration.

**xAI Alignment**: Grok's server-side agentic tool calling implements a production ReAct-style loop internally. The model decides tools, executes server-side (web_search, x_search, code_execution, collections_search), iterates until it can produce the final answer. Client sees only final (or streamed) output + optional reasoning tokens.

### 1.2 Production xAI Multi-Agent Orchestration (2026)
- **grok-4.20-multi-agent** (or equivalent): Launches configurable teams (4 agents for quick/focused; 16 for deep/comprehensive).
- **How the loop works**:
  - Server-side **realtime collaboration**: Multiple specialized agents run in parallel.
  - Each contributes reasoning, tool calls, findings.
  - **Leader agent** synthesizes discussion, cross-references, and delivers final structured answer.
  - Parallel tool invocation and iteration based on intermediate findings.
  - Sub-agent internal states encrypted/hidden by default (control + security); only leader outputs + (optionally) encrypted content exposed.
- **Strengths**: Deep multi-step research, structured outputs (tables, comparisons), realtime refinement, automatic tool use without client intervention in the loop.
- **Plan-first elements**: Complementary patterns in xAI tools like Grok Build CLI use explicit plan generation first, then parallel sub-agent execution (e.g., up to 8 sub-agents in isolated Git worktrees).

### 1.3 Hierarchical + Self-Evolving (AgentOrchestra / Surveys 2025-2026)
- **Central Planner / Orchestrator / Supervisor** at top level.
- Decomposes into sub-tasks → delegates to **specialized sub-agents** (Deep Researcher, Analyzer, Browser/Tool agents, Reporter, etc.).
- Each sub-agent runs its **own loop** (ReAct-style or domain-optimized).
- **Tree-structured routing** + results bubble up.
- **TEA Protocol inspiration** (Tool-Environment-Agent): Treat tools, environments, and agents as first-class, versioned, lifecycle-managed entities with standardized protocols for context, invocation, and evolution.
- **Closed feedback / Self-evolution**:
  - Reflection (verbal self-critique on traces).
  - Trace-based optimization (e.g., TextGrad-style: attribute errors → propose edits → validate on held-out → version/register).
  - Version manager: Register improved prompts/tools/agents; support rollback/select best.
  - Tracer for full execution trajectories (auditability + optimization signal).
- **Consolidation**: Planner aggregates sub-results, harmonizes evidence, resolves conflicts, updates global plan/state, or triggers refinement. Dedicated Reporter agent often handles final synthesis with citations/deduplication.
- **Performance evidence**: AgentOrchestra-style systems reach 89%+ on GAIA benchmark; sub-agents + self-evolution add double-digit gains; hierarchical routing improves scalability vs flat multi-agent.

**Overall Refined Model**: Start with ReAct core loop. Layer hierarchical delegation for complexity. Add explicit planning phase + reflection/critique gates + structured state/versioning for production reliability. xAI shows this can run server-side with strong orchestration primitives.

### 1.4 Cognitive Architecture Enhancements from Ranked Human Thinking Models (v3 Addition)

To further strengthen the loop against the failure modes detailed in Section 1.5, v3 explicitly incorporates high-adoption-priority traditional human thinking models (ranked by adoption priority for agent loops in the companion `thinking_model.md` — full table of 40 models with phases, similarities, strengths, and scores). These are mapped as first-class mechanisms rather than afterthoughts, delivering **adaptive intelligence** (context-aware routing), **proactive robustness** (pre-action risk), **efficient cognition** (fast/slow paths), and **deeper organizational learning** (double-loop + structured reflection). Prioritized models (scores 9–10) receive the deepest integration; others enhance specific sub-components (verifier, ideation, harmonization).

**Key Mappings & Operationalization in the v3 Loop**:

| Thinking Model (Rank / Score) | Primary Integration Point | How Operationalized (v3 Enhancement) | Key Benefit vs v2 Baseline |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Cynefin Framework** (1 / 10) | Phase 0 (post-spec) + Phase 1 entry/replan decision | Classify task context: Simple (clear cause-effect) / Complicated (expert analysis) / Complex (emergent) / Chaotic (crisis). Dynamically configure loop params: Fast Recognition Path enabled + lighter gates for Simple/Complicated; Full deliberative + heavy reflection/critics + deeper diagnostics for Complex/Chaotic. | Enables adaptive loop intensity (Fast vs Full) — highest-leverage addition for efficiency + reliability. |
| **Premortem Analysis** (2 / 10) | Phase 0 (after plan gen, before state commit) | Mandatory "assume spectacular failure in 6-12 months → work backward to identify top causes/risks → explicitly mitigate in living spec, success criteria, todo items, or agent roles." Can be run by orchestrator LLM or dedicated Red Team critic. | Directly strengthens Phase 0 planning with proactive risk simulation & critic; near-zero cost. |
| **After-Action Review (AAR)** (3 / 10) | Phase 4 (every milestone reflection or termination) | Structured 4-question template: (1) What was supposed to happen? (vs original spec/plan) (2) What actually happened? (from tracer/obs) (3) Why? (diagnosis) (4) What next? (lessons → concrete evolution actions). Feeds self-evolution. | Perfect upgrade for Phase 4 reflection + self-evolution; highly practical structured learning. |
| **Double-Loop Learning** (4 / 9.5) | Phase 4 (after AAR single-loop fixes) | After tactical fixes, explicitly ask: "What governing variables/assumptions (prompt templates, success criteria definitions, agent role boundaries, memory schemas, verification thresholds, or even the task decomposition strategy) led us here? Should they change at the meta level?" Only then commit versioned updates. | Core to making self-evolution truly powerful (double-loop) rather than symptom patching. |
| **Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD)** (5 / 9.5) + **Dual Process Theory (System 1 & 2)** (8 / 9) | Phase 1 (Thought/Decide step) + Memory layer | **Fast Recognition Path** (new): Before verbose ReAct, query Pattern Store (long-term memory of successful high-quality traces + outcome metadata + embeddings). If strong similarity match (and Cynefin context permits), perform lightweight mental simulation ("Similar to trace #47, expected good result with action Z") then act with minimal tokens. System 1 = fast/intuitive/RPD for routine/expert; System 2 = slow/deliberate full ReAct for novel/risky/uncertain. Metacognition (below) decides switch. Fallback to full loop on low confidence. | Enables high-value "Fast Recognition Path" in v3 for expert domains/repeated tasks; foundation for adaptive fast/slow thinking. |
| **Metacognition Cycle** (7 / 9) | Parallel lightweight process alongside all Phase 1 iterations | Ongoing: Planning (align intent to spec) → Monitoring (bias detection, context fit via Cynefin, progress vs todo/success criteria, confidence drift) → Evaluating (quick rigor pulse) → Adjust (trigger mode switch, early replan, or gate escalation in real time or at next decision). | Direct parallel to state management; easy to implement as lightweight meta-prompt or separate small LLM call. |
| **5 Whys + Ishikawa Fishbone + Fault Tree** (6 / 9) | Phase 4 (AAR "Why?" diagnosis) + Verifier/Critic issue analysis | On persistent failures or low-confidence observations: Drill with iterative 5 Whys; categorize root causes via Fishbone (People/Prompts, Process/Methods, Models/Tools, Data/Material, Environment/Context, Metrics) or simple fault tree. Results drive Double-Loop changes and spec hardening. | Greatly strengthens Thought + Reflection for complex problems; systematic visual + deep cause analysis. |
| **Red Team Thinking** (12 / 8) | Verifier / Phase 3 quality gates + Premortem | Dedicated critic mode or separate lightweight agent: "Adversarially attack this plan/draft/output to surface hidden weaknesses, edge cases, or single points of failure." Complements standard verifier schema. | Strong built-in devil’s advocate; easy to implement as dedicated critic agent role. |
| **Paul-Elder Critical Thinking Framework** (9 / 8.5) | Verifier prompt + Thought step augmentation | Enhance `verify_output` and decision prompts with Elements of Thought (purpose, question at issue, information, concepts, assumptions, inferences, implications, point of view) + Intellectual Standards checklist (clarity, accuracy, precision, relevance, depth, breadth, logic, significance, fairness, sufficiency). | Excellent for enhancing Thought and Verifier quality; strong bias and rigor detection. |
| **Theory of Constraints (TOC)** (10 / 8.5) + **TRIZ** (14 / 8) | Phase 3 (Harmonize/Consolidation) + conflict resolution in self-evolution | When sub-results conflict or goals contradict: Use TOC Evaporating Cloud to surface and resolve core conflicts; apply TRIZ contradiction principles for inventive solutions. Feeds versioned prompt/agent edits. | Powerful for resolving conflicting goals; synergizes extremely well with TRIZ and self-evolution. |
| **Six Thinking Hats** (13 / 8) + **SCAMPER / Osborn-Parnes CPS** (15/11) | Phase 3 consolidation or creative sub-agent ideation | Optional multi-perspective pass (White=facts/data, Red=intuition/feelings, Black=risks/critic, Yellow=benefits/opportunities, Green=creativity/alternatives, Blue=process/meta) or SCAMPER checklist (Substitute/Combine/Adapt/Modify/Put to other uses/Eliminate/Reverse) during synthesis or when sub-agent is creative-writing/design-oriented. | Reduces blind spots effectively; directly upgrades ideation and creative sub-agents. |

**Additional Implementation Details (v3)**:
- **Memory Architecture Upgrade**: Add "Pattern Store" (vector + metadata of successful/failed traces with outcome scores) to support RPD fast matching. Hierarchical memory now explicitly tags traces with Cynefin context type for better retrieval.
- **Verifier / Critic Enhancements**: `verify_output` function now accepts `critic_mode` (or runs ensemble): "standard" | "red_team" | "paul_elder" | "six_hats". Returns aggregated issues + suggestions. Can be parallelized for depth.
- **Configurability in Task Spec**: New fields e.g. `"cognitive_profile": {"enable_fast_path": true, "reflection_style": "aar_double_loop_5whys", "critic_modes": ["red_team", "paul_elder"], "cynefin_classification": "complex"}` or auto-detected.
- **Metacognition Implementation**: Lightweight parallel prompt or small dedicated LLM call every N steps or on confidence drop / context shift. Updates shared state flags (e.g., `current_mode: "fast" | "full"`, `bias_flags: [...]`).
- **Early Exit / Efficiency**: Cynefin + RPD + Metacognition together allow safe early termination or fast-pathing on well-understood sub-problems without sacrificing the rigorous gates on hard parts — directly mitigating token waste and infinite-loop risks.

These additions are **production-aware**: all new steps are bounded, versioned, logged via tracer, and can be toggled or depth-limited per task. They transform the agent from a capable ReAct/hierarchical engine (v2) into a more cognitively complete system that thinks about its own thinking, anticipates failure, learns at multiple levels, and adapts its deliberation style to context — while fully preserving every v2 mechanism, code example, and mitigation.

### 1.5 Known Problems, Failure Modes & Targeted Mitigations (Research-Backed)

Recent systematic studies (especially the **MASFT taxonomy** from analysis of 150+ traces across popular multi-agent frameworks) identify that **most failures stem from design/spec issues (~40%+)**, coordination breakdowns, and weak verification/termination — **not raw model intelligence**. Single-agent ReAct loops suffer overlapping issues plus context bloat and repetitive behavior. Below is a synthesized taxonomy of the most common, well-documented problems, with **actionable mitigations** mapped directly to the phases in this document.

### Major Problem Categories & Frequency/Significance
1. **Specification & Design Ambiguities (Largest Category)**
   - Disobeying or misinterpreting task spec, vague roles, missing success criteria or output contracts.
   - **Impact**: Agents go off-track early; errors compound downstream.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Phase 0: Mandatory structured Task Specification with explicit success criteria, constraints, output schema, and quality thresholds. Use "living spec" that can be updated.
     - Add automated spec validation (critic or schema check) before loop starts.
     - Clear role definitions and information contracts between orchestrator and sub-agents.

2. **Infinite Loops, Repetitive Actions & Thrashing**
   - Agent repeats the same (or similar) actions without progress; common in ReAct from poor exception handling or missing info; can be induced by prompt injection.
   - **Impact**: Wasted tokens/cost, timeouts, frustration (frequent real-world complaint).
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Phase 1 loop: Add **cycle detection** (state hashing of recent actions + observations; if similarity > threshold, force replan or terminate).
     - Explicit `max_steps`, `max_reflection_rounds`, and progress-based early exit (e.g., todo completion %).
     - Bounded reflection: Limit "improve this" iterations.
     - `Done` / `Finish` tool with mandatory verification before acceptance.
     - In hierarchical: Orchestrator monitors sub-agent progress and can kill/reassign stuck branches.

3. **Context Window Explosion / Context Rot / History Bloat**
   - Long trajectories cause key early info or instructions to be dropped; leads to inconsistency, repetition, goal drift.
   - **Impact**: Degraded performance in long-running or multi-turn tasks.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Aggressive hierarchical memory: Short-term working memory + long-term persistent store (vector search, semantic caching, MemGPT-style).
     - Summarization at milestones or when context > threshold (signal-aware truncation).
     - Structured state (`task.md`, todo list, key facts only) instead of dumping full history every turn.
     - Sub-agents receive only relevant context slices + provenance.

4. **Hallucinations, Error Compounding & Verification Weakness**
   - Fabricated facts, incorrect tool results interpretation, or unverified claims propagating (worse in multi-agent).
   - **Impact**: Unreliable final outputs; cascading failures.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - **Verifier / Critic agents** as mandatory quality gates (Phase 3 consolidation and after sub-results).
     - Structured observation schema (status, confidence, issues list) + cross-validation (compare across agents/sources).
     - Multi-form verification (factual grounding in observations + external checks).
     - Trajectory ranking (e.g., Prospector-style critic selects best among multiple attempts).
     - In self-evolution: Only commit changes validated on held-out traces.

5. **Inter-Agent Misalignment & Coordination Failures (Multi-Agent Specific)**
   - Role overstepping, conflicting goals, stale state sharing, communication gaps, error propagation between agents.
   - **Impact**: Poor collaboration; sometimes single strong agent outperforms complex MAS.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Strong central **Orchestrator/Planner** with explicit decomposition and routing (hierarchical control beats flat).
     - Information contracts + structured handoff formats.
     - Versioned shared state + durable coordination primitives (e.g., streams, pub/sub).
     - Circuit breakers: Detect inconsistency → pause, reconcile, or escalate.
     - Clear "Extreme hierarchical differentiation" (well-defined specialist roles).

6. **Termination & Goal Drift Problems**
   - Premature stopping (incomplete work) or failure to recognize completion; agents continue or give up wrongly.
   - **Impact**: Wrong or partial results.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Explicit success criteria in spec + progress tracking against them.
     - Dedicated termination action (`Done` tool) that must pass verifier.
     - Periodic alignment checks in Thought step vs original objective.
     - Early termination signals when intermediate results satisfy criteria.

7. **Other Notable Issues**
   - **State staleness & memory failures**: Use hybrid memory (fast short-term + persistent long-term with retrieval).
   - **Security (prompt injection → loops or misuse)**: Sandbox tools, input sanitization, least-privilege tool access, monitoring for anomalous loops.
   - **Cost & scalability overhead**: Multi-agent only when benefit > coordination cost; monitor token usage per phase; parallel where safe.
   - **Debuggability**: Full tracer + structured logs are non-negotiable.

### How Mitigations Integrate into the Loop Phases
- **Phase 0 (Init)**: Spec engineering + validation is the single highest-ROI fix.
- **Phase 1 (Core Loop)**: Cycle detection, bounded steps/reflection, structured observations, progress tracking.
- **Phase 2 (Delegation)**: Narrow sub-specs + contracts; orchestrator monitoring.
- **Phase 3 (Consolidation)**: Verifier/critic gates, cross-validation, harmonization.
- **Phase 4 (Reflection/Self-evolution)**: Validation before applying changes; bounded loops.
- **Phase 5 (Termination)**: Verifier + explicit Done with evidence.

**Key Insight from Research**: Fixing **specification quality + verification layers + explicit termination controls** delivers the largest reliability gains. Adding more agents or raw model power without these often yields diminishing or negative returns.

## 2. The Complete Agent Loop Process (Actionable)

### Phase 0: Initialization (Spec-Driven Setup)
**Goal**: Establish clear contract before any loop iterations.
1. Parse human instruction → generate/validate **Task Specification** (structured: objective, success criteria, constraints, output format, max budget/steps/tokens, quality thresholds).
2. Create **initial state**:
   - `task.md` or structured scratchpad (current plan, todo list, progress, open questions).
   - Memory: Short-term (recent observations), long-term (retrieved knowledge, past versions).
   - Tracer / execution log (for later reflection).
   - Version registry (for prompts/tools/agents if evolving).
3. **Optional Plan Generation** (Plan-and-Execute flavor, recommended for complex tasks):
   - Orchestrator LLM generates high-level plan (numbered steps or dependency graph).
   - Validate plan against spec (self-critique or dedicated critic).
   - Store in state.
4. **v3 Cognitive Enhancements (Cynefin + Premortem)**:
   - **Cynefin Classification** (context-aware routing): LLM or lightweight classifier tags the task (Simple / Complicated / Complex / Chaotic) based on clarity of cause-effect, expert knowledge needed, emergence, or crisis nature. Store in task_spec and use to auto-configure loop behavior (see 1.4 table): e.g., Simple/Complicated → prefer Fast Recognition Path + reduced reflection depth; Complex/Chaotic → enforce Full mode + AAR/Double-Loop + multi-critic ensemble.
   - **Premortem Analysis** (proactive risk critic): Before finalizing state, run dedicated step (orchestrator or Red Team critic): "Imagine this plan and spec have failed spectacularly after deployment. List the top 5-7 plausible causes. For each, propose concrete mitigations (update success_criteria, add todo risk items, tighten constraints, adjust agent roles, or add verification gates)." Merge mitigations into living spec and initial todo. This is now a recommended mandatory gate for all but the simplest tasks.
5. Decide architecture: Flat ReAct (simple) vs Hierarchical (complex research/coding) vs Hybrid. Also set initial `cognitive_profile` flags from Cynefin + task type (enable_fast_path, reflection_style, etc.).

**Actionable Output Format** (example JSON or Markdown section):
```json
{
  "task_id": "...",
  "objective": "...",
  "success_criteria": ["...", "..."],
  "constraints": ["max_steps: 50", "budget_tokens: 200k"],
  "output_format": "structured report with citations",
  "initial_plan": ["Step 1: ...", "Step 2: ..."],
  "quality_gates": ["completeness > 90%", "no hallucinations", "structured output"]
}
```

### Phase 1: Core Iteration Loop (ReAct-Inspired, Controlled)
While not terminated:
**v3 Mode Selection (Cynefin + RPD + Dual Process + Metacognition)**: At loop start or after major observation, determine operating mode:
- If Cynefin context is Simple/Complicated **and** high-similarity match found in Pattern Store (RPD) **and** metacognition confidence high → enter **Fast Recognition Path**: lightweight Thought (mental simulation only), skip verbose reasoning, proceed to action with minimal tokens. Log as "fast_path" for later AAR review.
- Otherwise (Complex/Chaotic, low pattern match, or explicit config) → **Full Deliberative Mode** (standard detailed ReAct Thought + full gates). Metacognition runs lightweight parallel monitor (bias scan, progress pulse, context drift check) and can force mode switch mid-iteration if uncertainty spikes.

1. **Observe Current State**: Load full/relevant history + task spec + current plan/todo + latest observations. (Summarize aggressively if context long — use memory manager. Also retrieve relevant Pattern Store entries for RPD matching.)
2. **Reason (Thought)**:
   - **Metacognitive overlay** (parallel): "Am I in the right mode? Any detected biases (per Paul-Elder)? Progress vs success criteria and todo? Context still matches Cynefin tag? Any governing assumptions to flag for Double-Loop later?"
   - Analyze progress vs success criteria.
   - Identify gaps, risks, exceptions.
   - Decide strategy: direct tool, delegate sub-task, synthesize so far, reflect/critique, or finish. (In Fast mode: keep this extremely concise.)
   - Update internal plan or todo if needed.
3. **Act / Decide Next** (strict structured output — parseable):
   - **Option A (Tool)**: Call built-in or custom tool (with args). xAI-style: server handles execution in loop.
   - **Option B (Delegate)**: Invoke sub-agent with narrow sub-instruction + context slice + success criteria for that sub-task. (Hierarchical)
   - **Option C (Internal)**: Update state/plan only, or run critic on draft.
   - **Option D (Finish)**: Output final answer if quality gates passed.
4. **Execute & Observe**:
   - Run action (tool or sub-agent loop).
   - Collect **structured observation**:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "success | partial | failed",
       "data": {...},
       "summary": "concise natural language",
       "confidence": 0.85,
       "issues": ["list of problems"],
       "next_suggestions": ["..."],
       "trace_id": "..."
     }
     ```
   - Append to history + update todo/state.
5. **Light Reflection** (every N steps or on failure): Quick self-critique — "Is this trajectory still aligned? Any obvious fix?"

**Circuit Breaker Pattern (Recommended for Production)**

Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures when a tool, LLM call, or sub-agent is repeatedly failing. They have three states:
- **CLOSED**: Normal operation, requests go through.
- **OPEN**: Too many failures → fast-fail immediately (protects the system).
- **HALF_OPEN**: After timeout, allow limited test requests to check recovery.

Use one circuit breaker per tool type or per sub-agent role. Integrate with the retry wrappers below.

**Code Example: Minimal Controlled ReAct Loop with Cycle Detection (Python)**

```python
import hashlib
from typing import Any, Dict, List
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class AgentState:
    task_spec: Dict[str, Any]
    history: List[Dict] = field(default_factory=list)
    todo: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    max_steps: int = 50
    seen_states: set = field(default_factory=set)  # for cycle detection

def hash_state(state: AgentState) -> str:
    """Simple cycle detection via recent action+obs hash"""
    recent = state.history[-3:] if len(state.history) > 3 else state.history
    return hashlib.md5(str(recent).encode()).hexdigest()

def controlled_react_loop(llm, tools, state: AgentState, max_retries: int = 3):
    import time
    import traceback

    step = 0
    while step < state.max_steps:
        step += 1
        current_hash = hash_state(state)
        if current_hash in state.seen_states:
            print("Cycle detected — forcing replan or terminate")
            # In production: trigger critic or escalate to human
            break
        state.seen_states.add(current_hash)

        try:

    result = llm.generate(prompt, output_schema=...)  # force JSON
    # Optional: if critic_mode == "ensemble": run red_team + paul_elder in parallel and aggregate
    return result
```

**Code Example: Simple Self-Evolution / Reflection Step (Trace → Edit → Validate)**

```python
def self_evolve_component(component_name: str, trace: List[dict], llm, version_manager):
    """Minimal TextGrad / reflection-style evolution"""
    diagnosis = llm.generate(
        f"Analyze this execution trace and identify the root cause of any failures or inefficiencies:\n{trace}",
        output_schema={"root_cause": str, "target_component": str, "proposed_edit": str}
    )
    
    if diagnosis.target_component == component_name:
        new_version = apply_edit(component_name, diagnosis.proposed_edit)
        # Validate on held-out or re-execution
        if validate_improvement(new_version, trace):
            version_manager.register(new_version, parent=component_name)
            return new_version
    return None  # no change or rollback
```

**Termination Conditions** (checked every iteration or at gates):
- Success criteria met + quality gate passed.
- Max steps / token budget / time reached.
- Explicit `Done` / `Finish` action with validated output.
- Irrecoverable failure (escalate to human or higher orchestrator).
- Early exit if intermediate result satisfies objective.

### Phase 2: Hierarchical Delegation & Sub-Loops
When orchestrator decides to delegate:
1. **Decompose & Route**:
   - Planner selects or instantiates appropriate sub-agent type (specialist role, toolset, prompt template).
   - Creates narrow sub-task spec (subset of parent objective + relevant context slice).
   - Invokes sub-agent (can be same LLM with different system prompt/role, or different model).
2. **Sub-Agent Runs Independent Loop**:
   - Sub-agent executes its own ReAct-style iterations (or optimized variant) against its sub-spec.
   - Maintains local state/memory.
   - Can further delegate (tree) or call tools.
3. **Return Structured Result** to parent (bubbles up):
   - Same structured observation format above.
   - Includes provenance (which sub-agent, trace summary).
4. **Parent Handles**:
   - Records in global state/tracer.
   - Validates/integrates (merge with other branches, resolve conflicts via harmonization step).
   - Updates global plan/todo.
   - Decides next: more delegation, direct action, consolidate, or critique.

**Parallelism**: Where dependencies allow (e.g., independent research branches), run multiple sub-agents/tools concurrently (xAI multi-agent style or worktree isolation like Grok Build).

### Phase 3: Consolidation, Synthesis & Restructuring
After sub-results or major milestones:
1. **Aggregate**: Collect all relevant observations + plan progress.
2. **Harmonize**: LLM (or dedicated Reporter agent) merges, deduplicates, cross-references, resolves contradictions. Produces unified view.
3. **Restructure**: Transform into target output shape (report, code, answer, updated plan). Enforce format from initial spec.
4. **Quality Gate**:
   - Run critic/refiner: Score against success criteria, check for hallucinations/gaps, suggest fixes.
   - If fails: Trigger refinement loop (re-plan, re-delegate specific parts, or self-edit).
   - If passes: Proceed (or do final polish).
5. **Update State**: Persist consolidated knowledge to long-term memory / versioned artifacts.

**Example Consolidator Prompt Snippet**:
"You are a synthesis expert. Given the original task spec, current plan, and these sub-results [structured list], produce: 1) Updated progress summary. 2) Any conflicts resolved. 3) Draft final output section. 4) Remaining gaps and recommended next actions."

### Phase 4: Reflection, Critique & Self-Evolution (Advanced)
**v3 Structured Reflection (AAR + Double-Loop + 5 Whys / Ishikawa + Paul-Elder / Red Team)**: All reflections now follow an explicit, multi-layered protocol (configurable via task_spec.reflection_style). This upgrades the original verbal self-critique into a rigorous, multi-model cognitive process.

- **Mandatory AAR Template** (applied at every milestone, failure, or termination; directly from After-Action Review best practice):
  1. **What was supposed to happen?** — Re-state relevant parts of original task_spec, success criteria, plan, and expected observations.
  2. **What actually happened?** — Summarize from tracer + structured observations (successes, partials, errors, key metrics). Include Fast vs Full mode usage stats if applicable.
  3. **Why? (Diagnosis)** — 
     - First pass: Standard attribution (TextGrad-style or LLM).
     - Deep pass (if issues or Cynefin=Complex): Apply **5 Whys** iteratively on top 2-3 problems. Then categorize using **Ishikawa Fishbone** (or lightweight fault tree): e.g., Prompts/Methods, Models/Tools/Agents, Data/Observations, Context/Environment, State/Memory, Verification Gates, Human Spec.
     - Cross-check with **Paul-Elder** lens: Which elements of thought were weak? Which intellectual standards violated (accuracy? depth? fairness?)?
  4. **What next? (Actionable Lessons)** — Concrete, versionable changes. Prioritize by impact/effort.

- **Double-Loop Learning Layer** (always after AAR single-loop diagnosis, before committing changes):
  - "Beyond fixing the immediate symptoms: What *governing variables* or foundational assumptions created the conditions for this outcome? Examples: Was our definition of 'quality output' too loose? Did agent role boundaries allow drift? Is the memory retrieval strategy misaligned with task type? Should success criteria themselves evolve? Should we add new critic roles or change loop routing logic?"
  - Only changes that survive this meta-question are proposed for validation + registration. This prevents superficial patching and enables genuine architectural self-improvement.

- **Per-trajectory or milestone reflection** (original): LLM summarizes trace, diagnoses failures/successes, proposes improvements (prompt edits, tool patches, new sub-agent types). Now wrapped inside the AAR + Double-Loop structure above.

- **Self-evolution loop** (inspired by AgentOrchestra, enhanced):
  1. Collect trace via tracer + AAR output.
  2. Attribute errors / opportunities (LLM or TextGrad-style) **within AAR/Double-Loop frame**.
  3. Propose targeted changes (to prompts, tools, agent configs, success criteria, or even generated code / memory schemas).
  4. Validate changes (re-execute on held-out or similar task; check metrics; optionally re-run Premortem on proposed new version).
  5. If improved (and Double-Loop approved): Register new version (with lineage + AAR justification). Support rollback. Update Pattern Store with outcome metadata for future RPD use.
  6. Optional: If change is meta (e.g., new critic mode or routing rule), propagate to cognitive_profile defaults.

- **Critic Agent Role** (enhanced): Separate lightweight agent that reviews drafts/plans without full execution. Can be invoked at gates. Now supports multiple modes (standard | red_team | paul_elder | six_hats | ensemble) as defined in Section 1.4. Red Team mode is especially recommended during Premortem and high-stakes consolidation.

- **Benefits**: Continuous improvement during runtime; production systems become more robust over repeated use on similar task distributions. The combination of AAR structure, Double-Loop depth, systematic root-cause (5 Whys/Fishbone), and multi-perspective critics (Paul-Elder/Red Team) makes Phase 4 a true engine for compounding intelligence rather than just incremental fixes. Fast-path traces are still reviewed (lighter AAR) so the system can learn when to trust RPD matches.

**Implementation Tip**: Store AAR outputs as structured artifacts linked to versions in the registry. This creates an auditable "learning history" that future agents (or the same system on similar tasks) can retrieve for RPD-style pattern matching.

### Phase 5: Termination & Output
- When gates passed or termination condition met:
  1. Final synthesis pass.
  2. Structured final output (match spec).
  3. Optional: Post-hoc reflection summary for user or logging.
  4. Persist full trace + versions for audit/replay/debug.
- **Human-in-loop hooks**: At quality gate failures, high-stakes actions, or budget exhaustion.

## 3. State, Memory & Infrastructure Recommendations

- **State Schema**: task_spec + current_plan/todo + history (thought/action/observation tuples) + memory (key-value or vector) + versions + tracer.
- **Memory Management**: Hierarchical (local per sub-agent + global). Summarization on context pressure. Session-isolated for concurrency.
- **Tracing**: Full execution graph (who called what, results, timings, versions). Enables debugging, reflection, and optimization.
- **Versioning** (TEA-inspired): Prompts, tools, agent roles, generated artifacts — all versioned with semantic lineage and rollback.
- **xAI Integration Tips**:
  - Use Grok multi-agent mode for research-heavy top-level tasks.
  - Mix server-side agentic tools with client-side custom tools (hybrid).
  - For coding agents: Adopt plan-first + parallel sub-agents in isolated environments (worktrees).
  - Stream reasoning tokens when possible for transparency.
- **Production Hardening**:
  - Strict output schemas (JSON mode or constrained decoding).
  - Timeouts, retry with backoff, circuit breakers on failing tools/sub-agents.
  - Cost/token budgets + monitoring.
  - Logging + observability (every thought/action/observation).
  - Sandboxed execution for tools/code.

## 4. Decision Framework (When to Use What)

| Task Complexity       | Recommended Pattern                  | Key Features to Enable          | Example Use Case |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|
| Simple fact lookup    | Flat ReAct (single loop)            | Tool calling, basic thought    | Quick search + answer |
| Multi-step research   | xAI Multi-Agent or Hierarchical     | Parallel agents, leader synth  | Deep analysis with sources |
| Coding / long project | Plan-first + Hierarchical + Worktrees | Sub-agents in isolation, todo.md | Full app generation + debug |
| Open-ended / creative | ReAct + Reflection + Self-evolution | Critic gates, versioned prompts| Iterative design refinement |
| High-stakes / reliable| All above + strong Quality Gates    | Structured results, validation | Enterprise automation |

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Mitigations (from Research)

**Primary reference: See the full MASFT-style taxonomy, failure modes, and phase-specific mitigations in Section 1.5 above.** The points below are retained for quick scanning and now include additional patterns from recent studies.

- **Context explosion**: Aggressive summarization + hierarchical state (local sub-memories).
- **Infinite loops / thrashing**: Hard max iterations + progress tracking in todo + critic that can force replan or escalate.
- **Poor consolidation**: Mandate structured sub-results + dedicated harmonization/reporter step.
- **Hallucinations in plans**: Ground every major claim in observations; use critic before committing to plan.
- **Brittle delegation**: Use explicit sub-task specs + success criteria; validate returned results.
- **Lack of visibility**: Full tracing + optional streaming of reasoning.

## 6. Quick-Start Pseudocode Skeleton (Python-like)

```python
def agent_loop(task_instruction, tools, sub_agent_registry, max_steps=50):
    state = initialize_state(task_instruction)  # spec, plan, todo, memory, tracer
    orchestrator = get_llm(role="orchestrator")
    
    while not should_terminate(state, max_steps):
        # 1. Observe
        context = build_context(state)
        
        # 2. Reason + Decide
        decision = orchestrator.generate(
            prompt=build_decision_prompt(context, state.spec),
            output_schema=DECISION_SCHEMA  # thought, action_type, payload
        )
        
        if decision.action_type == "tool":
            obs = execute_tool(decision.payload, tools)
        elif decision.action_type == "delegate":
            sub_result = invoke_sub_agent(decision.payload, sub_agent_registry)  # runs its own loop
            obs = structured_observation_from(sub_result)
        elif decision.action_type == "synthesize":
            obs = consolidate_and_gate(state)
        elif decision.action_type == "finish":
            return finalize_output(state, decision)
        
        # 3. Update state
        state.history.append(decision.thought, decision, obs)
        state = update_todo_and_plan(state, obs)
        
        # 4. Optional light reflection or full self-evolution pass
        if should_reflect(state):
            state = reflect_and_evolve(state)  # critique + version updates
    
    return handle_termination(state)
```

Sub-agent invoke follows the same pattern recursively (narrower scope).

## 1. System Overview

The **VA-Agent-Swarm** is a hierarchical multi-agent system (MAS) designed to fully automate (or augment) professional video production — from initial creative brief through final delivery across all distribution channels. The system comprises **114 specialized agents** organized into 10 functional categories, supported by dedicated infrastructure agents, a shared critique bus, and a unified orchestration runtime.


### Core Design Principles

| Principle | Description | Reference |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Agentic Graph** | Agents as DAG nodes with handoffs and review gates | [ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §1 |
| **Self-Refine + Critique** | Every agent drafts → self-critiques → revises against rubric | Madaan et al., 2023 |
| **Shared Artifact Contract** | Machine-readable manifests flow between all phases | [ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §1.3 |
| **Human-in-the-Loop Gates** | Critical decisions escalate to human approval | [agents.md](./agents.md) — ProducerAgent |
| **Provenance (C2PA)** | Every artifact is signed; downstream agents verify chain | C2PA spec |
| **Continuous Self-Improvement** | Agents learn from outcomes, store episodic memory, ratchet quality | Reflexion (Shinn 2023) |

### 7.1 Critique Bus Protocol

All agents communicate critique via a structured JSON bus:

```json
{
  "from_agent": "EditorAgent",
  "to_agent": "DirectorAgent",
  "critique_type": "pacing_feedback",
  "severity": "suggestion",
  "artifact_ref": "artifact_id_123_v2",
  "message": "Scene 3 pacing exceeds genre-prior by 15%; suggest trim.",
  "rubric_score": 0.72,
  "timestamp": "2026-05-27T10:30:00Z"
}
```

- **§14** is a literal **100-point hardening checklist** (10 themes × 10 checks). The system is not "done" until all 100 pass.
- The reference workflow already defines a **100-pass reassessment discipline** ([`ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md`](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §1.4). This build plan inherits it: every milestone's acceptance is re-challenged across the five bands (traceability → architecture → handoffs → metrics → wording).
- Every agent you build must clear the system's own **L1/L2/L3 quality framework** and the **Q1–Q6 delivery QC mesh** (§5.5). Quality is recursive: the system that judges videos must itself be judged.

**Acceptance rules (implement in `agent-core`, test exhaustively):**
- `blocker` → halts the DAG node until resolved (Temporal signal / LangGraph interrupt).
- `major` → triggers Self-Refine/Reflexion loop on the receiver, **max 3 iterations**, then escalate to JudgeAgent.
- `minor`/`nit` → logged to MemoryAgent; aggregated as RLAIF reward signal for the next training cycle.
- Two-agent disputes → routed to JudgeAgent (multi-agent debate). ComplianceAgent critiques are always `blocker` (BLOCK gate).

| API | Layer | Mechanism | Pass |
|-----|-------|-----------|------|
| `qc.l1_spec(artifact)` | Spec | JSON-schema + tool validators (codec/LUFS/aspect/length) | 100% |
| `qc.l2_rubric(artifact, rubric)` | Rubric | LLM-as-judge w/ role constitution | ≥85/100 |
| `qc.l3_preference(artifact, baseline)` | Preference | Pairwise vs human ref + AudienceSim ≥200 personas + ≥20 HiTL | ≥0.50 parity / ≥0.55 surpass |
| `qc.delivery(artifact)` | Q1–Q6 | spec / artifact / audio-sync / continuity / perceptual / outlet-readiness | all 6 pass |

**Build note:** L1 and Q1/Q3/Q6 are deterministic validators (build first, fully testable). L2/L3/Q5 use LLM/sim judges (build with frozen-judge + golden sets to keep them stable; never let a judge model float unpinned).

**Build:**
- `packages/eventbus`: typed Redis Streams pub/sub; topic contract (§5.7); replayable; at-least-once + idempotency keys.
- `packages/observability`: OTel tracing + structured logs + LangSmith hookup; every node run is a span.
- `services/orchestrator`:
  - **LangGraph graph runtime**: nodes = agent tasks; conditional edges; **HiTL interrupt** points (gates); checkpointer backed by Postgres.
  - **Temporal workflows/activities**: each agent task is a Temporal activity (retry/backoff/timeout); the production is a Temporal workflow (resumable across restarts).
  - **OrchestratorAgent / PlannerAgent / RouterAgent / JudgeAgent / GateKeeperAgent / MemoryAgent** skeletons (agents #53–58) — these are *platform* agents, built here, refined in M8.
  - DAG primitives: fan-out/fan-in, dependency-triggered rerender, deadlock detection, SLA timers.
- `packages/memory`: episodic + long-term project memory (Reflexion/MemGPT pattern) over the vector DB; `MemoryAgent` retrieval API.
- Asset/Data backbone: immutable `artifact_id`, copy-on-write versions, dependency edges, searchable metadata (Postgres + S3/MinIO), C2PA signing via `packages/provenance`.
- State store: production state machine; gate state; durable, auditable, resumable.

**Build:**
- `packages/llm-gateway`: litellm wrapper exposing `complete()/stream()/embed()` with: provider/model abstraction (Grok-4.x, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Claude 4, OSS), automatic retry/fallback, **per-call token+cost metering** emitted to the bus (`budget_update`), prompt+model **version tagging** into provenance (G5), response caching, and a **frozen-judge** mode for QC.
- **RouterAgent (#55)** real impl: capability registry + benchmark history → pick agent/model by cost/quality/latency; budget-aware. **CostOptimizerAgent (#74)** hooks.
- **LLM Usage Dashboard** backend: aggregates spend per production/agent/provider; alert thresholds; exposes `/api/llm-usage`.
- Budget guardrails: per-production budget envelope; hard stop + escalation when exceeded (ProducerAgent gate).

**Build:**
- **Orchestration (53–58):** harden Orchestrator/Planner/Router/Judge/GateKeeper/Memory with full dispute-resolution (multi-agent debate), stage-gate sign-off, and escaped-defect=0 discipline.
- **Creative (59–65):** Ideation, NarrativeArc, StyleTransfer, MoodBoard, Novelty/Anti-Cliché, EmotionalArc, WorldBuilding — many delegate to GCA/Aesthetics (no duplication).
- **Research (66–72):** Web/Archive/Trend/Competitor/Citation/InterviewSynthesis/Benchmark — built on the M4 Research Agent core.
- **Optimization (73–80):** Prompt/Cost/Latency/Retention/ROAS/Accessibility optimizers + EvaluationHarness + SafetyRedTeam.
- **Full QC mesh**: complete L3 (AudienceSim ≥200 personas + HiTL sampling) and Q1–Q6 delivery validators; `GateKeeperAgent` enforces "zero leaked defects."

**Tests:** Judge inter-rater agreement κ≥0.8 vs a fixture human-panel; GateKeeper blocks a seeded defect; SafetyRedTeam attack-success ≤1% on the seeded attack set; EvaluationHarness detects an injected regression <1h; AudienceSim L3 win-rate computed on a golden pair.

**Steps:**
1. **Read (subagent).** `spec-reader` extracts the six fields above into a structured `AgentBrief`.
2. **Map self-quality → metrics.** Convert "Self-Quality Criteria" into concrete `MetricSpec`s with thresholds (e.g., DoP `rule_of_thirds>=τ, exposure_zone∈[III,VII], color_temp_var<=ΔK`; Colorist `deltaE<2`; SoundMixer `lufs==target, stoi>=0.85`). Many map to existing `packages/qc` validators or the Aesthetics Agent.
3. **Author the L2 rubric/constitution.** Turn "Surpass-Human Signal" + craft sources into a role constitution in `eval/rubrics/<agent>.yaml` (this is what LLM-as-judge scores against). Cite the craft authority named in the spec (Murch's Rule of Six for Editor, 12 principles for Animator, etc.).
4. **Define tools.** Allowlist only the providers/tools this agent may call (e.g., PromptEngineer → MediaGenProvider; Colorist → grade tool; FactChecker → RAG + WebResearch). Enforced by `agent-core`.
5. **Wire critique edges.** From the §4 critique matrix: `critiques_from` and `critiques_on`. ComplianceAgent edges are always blocking.
6. **Write the AgentConfig (YAML)** and register in `agents/_registry.yaml`.
7. **Author the versioned system prompt** (`agents/.../prompt.vN.md`) embedding role, constitution summary, self-refine instruction, and output schema (must emit a valid `Artifact`).
8. **TDD (subagent `test-author`):** golden-input fixtures → assert L1 schema pass, L2 rubric ≥85, correct critique emission/acceptance, tool-allowlist enforcement, metering present, provenance populated.
9. **Implement = instantiate.** `AgentFactory.build(config)` — no new code path; if you find yourself writing bespoke logic, that logic belongs in `agent-core` or a tool, not the agent.
10. **Review (subagent `code-reviewer`)** against DoD + §14 themes; fix; commit `feat(agent-<n>): <Name>`.
11. **Register in workflows** that use it; extend the relevant archetype integration test.

### 9.4 Behavioral / golden-set evaluation (the L1/L2/L3 mesh on the system itself)
- **Golden sets** in `eval/golden/`: frozen brief→expected fixtures per agent and per workflow. Inputs and expected structured outputs are version-controlled.
- **L2 judges are frozen + pinned** (specific model + prompt version) to keep scores stable across runs; never let a judge model float (regression-noise killer).
- **L3 AudienceSim**: ≥200 simulated personas (from Psychological Profiling, M11) + ≥20 HiTL samples; reports win-rate vs the stored human/baseline reference.
- **`EvaluationHarnessAgent` (#79)** runs these nightly and on every PR touching an agent; posts regressions to `system.alerts`.

The structure of the map should be MECE: mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. The answers themselves should be independent and collectively exhaustive. Teams are encouraged to generate possible answers before committing to a structure, defer criticism during generation, and continue drilling only while additional detail brings practical value. A map should be insightful, not merely exhaustive. Teams should ask the "so what?" question to judge whether a branch actually improves understanding.

For final comparison, the model uses multiattribute decision analysis. A decision maker identifies the alternatives and the attributes on which they should be judged. The attribute set should be complete, operational, decomposable, nonredundant, and minimal. Typical attributes include likelihood of success, timeliness, speed, and cost.

**Key Design Principles**
- **Metadata First**: Hard constraints eliminate 70-80% of irrelevant files instantly.
- **Graph-Guided Intelligence**: Relationships between concepts (e.g., “character consistency techniques improve multi-shot narrative in Seedance”) enable smarter routing.
- **Iterative Refinement**: For complex queries (full AI video production pipeline), Planner + iterative evaluation/simplification (RopMura style).
- **Self-Reflection**: The Router itself uses reflection tokens / critic steps (Self-RAG inspired) to judge its own retrieval quality before finalizing output.
- **Generalized + Extensible**: Core logic is domain-agnostic; domain packs and agent_relevance tags make it powerful for your AI Filmmaking + AI Agents corpus.

### 4.6 Multi-Level Critic (Self-Improving Core)
Three levels:
1. **Retrieval Critic**: Scores relevance, coverage of required_concepts, handling of previous_failures.
2. **Routing Critic**: Judges whether the right files were chosen vs alternatives; suggests better tags or graph edges.
3. **Downstream Utility Critic**: (Ideal) Observes or gets feedback from the requesting agent after it uses the context (“Did this knowledge help you succeed? What was missing?”). Feeds back as soft supervision signal (like AgentRouter’s F1-based training targets).

**Research-Backed Design Principles**
- **Multi-agent critic patterns** (xAI Grok Multi-Agent + SAGE): Use specialized roles (Actor/Solver + Critic/Challenger + optional Judge) that can work in parallel. Each sub-agent shows its reasoning for full auditability and transparency.
- **Structured self-critique** (SCALAR, Reflexion, Self-Refine): Move beyond vague feedback. Use explicit verification of preconditions, state tracking, rubric scoring, and episodic memory of past reflections/critiques.
- **Human-in-the-loop safety** (strong research consensus): All high-impact changes require human confirmation. Optional human guidance when domain knowledge evolves rapidly.
- **Memory & context management**: Support hierarchical summaries, reflection storage, and context folding for long-horizon tasks (enhancing claude-mem with ideas from AgentFold / Recursive Language Models research).
- **Transparency & auditability** (core xAI philosophy): Every sub-agent reasoning step, critique, and decision is logged and reviewable.
- **ECC-first + Research layer**: Start with ECC’s existing review/critique capabilities as the foundation, then layer on stronger multi-agent critic loops and structured reflection.



### From `corpus/root/project_starter_0.2.md` Copy: `sources/excerpts/project_starter_0.2.md`.


- **Actor/Solver:** Implements the task.  
- **Critic:** Reviews correctness, simplicity, spec adherence, security, performance, maintainability.  
- **Security Critic:** Optional focused security pass.  
- **Test Critic:** Optional test and verification pass.  
- **Judge:** Summarizes blocking vs non-blocking findings.

## Migration capability research (v1 honest · 2026-07-13)

Role-specific capability research for **JudgeAgent** (`video.judge`, va_id=56, category `9-Meta`).

### Responsibility focus
Adjudicates disputes via multi-agent debate; scores against rubric

### Prompt research topics (source of truth for S3)
- arXiv topics: 1. Retrieve and integrate state-of-the-art research findings from arXiv papers relevant to: LLM-as-judge, multi-agent debate, critique aggregation, preference learning for media QA
- X topics: 2. Analyze and incorporate expert insights from x.ai (Twitter/X) from recognized industry and academic leaders specializing in: AI judges for content quality, multi-agent critique, video QA with LLMs
- YouTube topics: 3. Extract detailed, actionable technical guidance from high-quality YouTube content created by domain experts focused on: LLM-as-a-judge for video, multi-agent critique workflows, AI quality arbitration

### arXiv / academic integration (role-applied)
- Du et al. multi-agent debate for factuality
- Zheng et al. LLM-as-Judge / MT-Bench rubrics; inter-rater κ targets

**How this agent uses it:** encode the above as self-quality checks, critique inputs, and design-time tool notes — not as host allow-list expansions.

### X / industry practice (role-applied)
- Arena-style pairwise judging for creative disputes

### YouTube / practitioner guidance (role-applied)
- Rubric adjudication workflows for creative reviews

### Implementation notes for v1
1. Emit artifacts matching role responsibility; self-score against Self-quality criteria.
2. Accept critique only from listed critics; escalate disputes to Judge/Gate as DNA dictates.
3. Design-time tools remain documented only; runtime tools stay in `agent_spec.json`.
4. N1: no second control plane; video logic under `business/video/**` only.

### Research depth note (honest)
This v1 section maps **role-family** literature and the agent’s migration prompt topics into SPEC.
It is **not** a full unsummarized download of every paper/video transcript.
Live primary-source expansion remains a residual for score 100 on S3 where depth is still thin.
