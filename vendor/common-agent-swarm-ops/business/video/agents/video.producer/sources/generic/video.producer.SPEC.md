## Responsibility

Budget, schedule, hiring, delivery; greenlights phase gates

## Knowledge distillation sources

PGA Producers Mark; Variety/Deadline budget leaks; LineProducer Excel corpora

## Self-quality criteria

On-time delivery rate; budget variance <±5%; talent satisfaction (RLHF)

## Surpass-human signal

Beats PGA schedules at 0.6× cost with equal CSAT

## Critique bus

- **Accepts critique from:** All downstream agents (escalations); HiTL gate for greenlight

- **Comments on:** DirectorAgent (scope creep), AllAgents (resource burn)

## Tools (design-time documentation)

Google Sheets API, Airtable, Temporal/Airflow orchestration, Stripe billing

**Runtime safety:** Host allow-lists are only `agent_spec.json` + `tool-permission-register.json`. CI uses video_* stubs. Do not treat design-time vendor names as enabled APIs.

## Architecture pattern

Agentic Graph (LangGraph DAG) + ReAct for tool calls

## Common structure of an AI agent (full §11 from agents.md)

## 11. Common Structure of an AI Agent

Every agent — regardless of category — implements this skeleton. Derived from the source document's architecture patterns (§1), critique protocol (§6), and universal success-criteria framework (§5), enriched with current (2026) tooling research.

### 11.1 Architecture Diagram

The diagram below presents the common agent as a professional operating architecture rather than a simple component sketch. It shows how **orchestration**, the **input contract**, **knowledge and tool surfaces**, the internal **plan → act → self-review** loop, **traceability and provenance controls**, the **3-layer quality gate** (Spec → Rubric → Preference), **release packaging**, **peer critique**, **human escalation**, and **continuous improvement** work together as one governed system.

### 11.2 Component Reference Table

| # | Component | Purpose | Mechanism / Implementation Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Identity** | Stable unique handle for routing, logging, provenance | Kebab-case ID + semantic version (e.g. `director-agent@2.1.0`). Registered in the agent-capability registry used by RouterAgent. |
| 2 | **Responsibility (Scope)** | Single-sentence definition of what the agent owns | Mirrors a human craft role. Prevents scope overlap via explicit boundary documented in the registry. |
| 3 | **Knowledge Distillation Source** | Licensed/consented corpora the agent is trained or RAG-grounded on | Award archives, academic papers, expert interviews, peer-reviewed journals. Refreshed via Continuous Distillation Loop (§7 of source). |
| 4 | **Tool Access** | External APIs, generators, validators, DCC bridges | Video gen: Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (Gemini API), Runway Gen-4/Aleph, Kling 3.0. Voice: ElevenLabs v3, Sync.so, HeyGen. DCC: Resolve/Nuke/AE via MCP bridges. All accessed via MCP (Model Context Protocol, Anthropic 2024). |
| 5 | **Architecture Pattern** | Reasoning/learning loop powering the agent | One or more of: Self-Refine [1], Reflexion [2], RLAIF/Constitutional AI [3], Multi-agent debate [4], LLM-as-Judge [5], Pairwise preference (Arena) [5], ReAct [6], Agentic Graph (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) [7], DSPy/OPRO prompt optimization [8]. |
| 6 | **Memory** | Episodic + long-term project memory | Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant) accessed via MemoryAgent. Implements MemGPT-style hierarchical memory with summarization and eviction. Reflexion agents store verbal self-feedback here. |
| 7 | **Constitution / Rubric** | Written, role-specific scoring guide for self-check | Examples: Murch's Rule of Six (Editor), 12 Principles (Animator), Save-the-Cat beats (Screenwriter), WCAG 2.2 (Accessibility), FAA Part 107 (Drone), SAG-AFTRA AI rider (Consent). Used as the "constitution" in Constitutional AI pattern. |
| 8 | **Self-Quality: L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema validation + tool validators (codec, LUFS, aspect ratio, frame count, file format). Must pass 100%. |
| 9 | **Self-Quality: L2 Rubric** | Does it meet craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-Judge (Zheng 2023) with role-specific constitution. Must score ≥85/100. Up to 3 Self-Refine iterations if below threshold. |
| 10 | **Self-Quality: L3 Preference** | Would target audience choose this over human baseline? | Pairwise comparison: AudienceSim panel (≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples). Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass). |
| 11 | **Surpass-Human Signal** | Pre-registered proof the agent exceeds a credentialed professional | Benchmark dominance; blind Arena preference ≥55%; speed × quality (equal L2 at ≤10% turnaround); lower 90-day defect rate; certification pass; higher novelty at equal quality. |
| 12 | **Critique Inbox** | Channel for receiving structured feedback from peers | Shared `CritiqueMessage` JSON bus. Severities: blocker (halts DAG), major (Self-Refine ≤3 iters), minor/nit (logged for RLAIF). Disputes → JudgeAgent multi-agent debate → HiTL if unresolved. |
| 13 | **Critique Outbox** | Peer agents whose work this agent is qualified to review | Defined per-agent in roster. Messages emitted on same bus. Evidence-backed, rubric-referenced, appended to C2PA provenance. |
| 14 | **HiTL Escalation** | When a human must be brought in | Consent (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50); final legal sign-off; MPA rating; festival eligibility; crisis comms; cross-cultural sensitivity. |
| 15 | **Provenance (C2PA)** | Cryptographic signing of every artifact | Every emitted artifact signed with C2PA (c2patool). Downstream agents verify chain. Accepted critiques appended to manifest. Platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Meta) auto-label based on C2PA presence. |
| 16 | **Continuous Learning** | How the agent keeps improving post-deployment | Bootstrap (licensed corpora) → Expert interviews (paid, consented) → Live RLAIF (DPO/KTO) → Award-rubric grounding → Adversarial red-team → 30/60/90-day reality check (retention, ROAS, awards). |
| 17 | **Orchestration Integration** | How the agent fits the multi-agent graph | Registered as a node in LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen DAG. OrchestratorAgent schedules; PlannerAgent assigns; RouterAgent selects model/provider; GateKeeperAgent verifies L1-L3 before advancing. |

**Deep Intent Analysis Framework (DIA) v2.0**  
**Comprehensive Functional Specification Document**

**Version:** 2.0 (Research-Enhanced)  
**Date:** May 26, 2026  
**Status:** Complete Functional Specification  
**Basis:** Original 6-phase DIA (from conversation history) + deep integration of 2025–2026 arXiv research on computational pragmatics, speech act theory, LLM-based intent/implicature reasoning, multi-party discourse analysis, and xAI Grok capabilities.

---

### 1. Executive Summary

The **Deep Intent Analysis Framework (DIA) v2.0** is a complete, production-ready, modular system for systematically decoding any text’s **purpose**, **hidden agenda**, **multi-angle perspectives**, **illocutionary force**, and **ethical/behavioral quality**.  

It transforms the original 6-phase manual/LLM-prompt pipeline into a **fully specified, agentic, evaluable software system** built on xAI’s Grok-4.3 (or latest) with native tool use, 1M+ token context, structured outputs, and low-hallucination reasoning.

**Core Objectives**  
- Answer: *Why does this language exist? What is the real goal? What is hidden? How many angles exist? Is the behavior good/wrong/effective?*  
- Achieve human-expert-level pragmatic reasoning at scale.  
- Support manual use, API, web app, IDE plugin, and enterprise analytics.

**Key v2.0 Improvements (from arXiv + xAI research)**  
- **Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC)** integration for superior implicature & hidden-agenda detection.  
- **Multi-Perspective Agent Simulation** (inspired by multi-party conversational agents survey) for richer angle mapping.  
- **Gricean + Extended Maxims** (including Benevolence & Transparency for AI contexts).  
- **Automated Speech Act / Dialog Act Classification** using recent taxonomies and LLM judges.  
- **Hybrid Evaluation Pipeline** (automatic metrics + human-in-the-loop).  
- **Native xAI Integration**: Grok-4.3 reasoning modes, tool calling, real-time search for context validation.

**Target Users**  
Journalists, analysts, researchers, educators, content moderators, legal teams, AI safety engineers, and power users who want to “see through” language.

---

### 2. Background, Motivation & Research Foundation

**Original Motivation (from user history)**  
Language serves communication, but always with purpose, hidden intent, multiple angles, and moral implications. The 6-phase DIA provides a repeatable algorithm.

**2025–2026 Research Integration** (selected key sources)

- **Pragmatics in the Era of LLMs Survey** (arXiv:2502.12378): Comprehensive datasets for speech acts, implicature, social pragmatics; highlights LLM gaps in deeper pragmatic reasoning and English-centric bias. Recommends hybrid evaluation and theory-grounded prompting.

- **Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC)** (arXiv:2503.01539): 4-step relevance-theory-based prompting dramatically improves implicit toxicity / hidden bias detection (GPT-4o: +12.26 pp). Explicitly separates literal meaning, metaphors, norm violation, and judgment. Directly enhances Phase 3 & 4.

- **Multi-Party Conversational Agents Survey** (arXiv:2505.18845): State-of-Mind taxonomy (Emotion, Engagement, Personality Big-Five, Dialog Acts); discourse structure; Theory of Mind (ToM) for multi-perspective modeling. Enables true multi-angle simulation.

- **Gricean Maxims in NLP & Human-AI Interaction**: Multiple papers extend Grice with Benevolence & Transparency maxims for AI; use maxim-violation detection for offensive/hidden-agenda texts.

- **xAI / Grok Research**: Grok-4.3 excels at agentic tool use, long-context reasoning, low hallucination, and social role mediation (truth arbiter, adversary). Ideal backbone for DIA as a trustworthy, multi-role analysis agent.

These findings directly upgrade the original framework into a **scientifically grounded, computationally implementable specification**.

### 4. Detailed Functional Requirements – 6 Phases (v2.0 Enhanced)

#### Phase 0: Context Analyzer
**Inputs**: Raw text, optional metadata (sender, platform, date, prior messages).  
**Processing**: LLM extracts sender power/relationship, audience, medium norms, trigger event; bias self-check prompt.  
**Enhancement**: Real-time search tool for historical/cultural context.  
**Output**: Structured context object + confidence.

#### Phase 1: Purpose Categorization (Jakobson Functions)
**Table** (unchanged but now LLM-ranked with evidence): Referential, Emotive, Conative, Phatic, Metalingual, Poetic.  
**v2.0**: Multi-label classification with probability distribution + justification.

#### Phase 2: Surface Literal Analysis
**Checklist** (facts vs opinions, loaded words, voice, omissions, ambiguity).  
**Enhancement**: Embedding-based vagueness scoring + coreference resolution.

#### Phase 3: Pragmatic & Speech Act Engine (Core Upgrade)
**Components**:
- **Searle’s 5 Categories** (Assertives, Directives, Commissives, Expressives, Declaratives) + fine-grained taxonomies from Parliamentary Debates & CyberAgressionAdo-v2 (“attack”, “defend”, etc.).
- **Grice Maxim Violation Detector**: Automated scoring (Quantity, Quality, Relation, Manner) + extended maxims (Benevolence, Transparency).
- **PIC Integration** (mandatory for hidden agenda):
  1. Explain metaphors/special meanings (layperson language).
  2. Literal meaning (layperson language).
  3. Identify contradictions with relevant social/ethical norms (equality, truth-seeking, non-manipulation, etc.).
  4. Final implicature judgment.

**Output per utterance**: `{illocutionary_act, perlocutionary_effect, maxim_violations: [...], implicature: "...", confidence}`

#### Phase 4: Hidden Agenda & Multi-Angle Dissection (Major Upgrade)
**Steps**:
1. Explicit vs Implicit goals (power, status, division, validation…).
2. Power & ideology scan (CDA-style: who benefits? us vs them?).
3. **Multi-Perspective Agent Simulation** (new): Spawn 4–6 parallel Grok agents, each embodying one POV (speaker, receiver, opponent, society, historical, environmental). Each produces angle summary + evidence. Aggregate with clustering.
4. Framing analysis + inconsistency detection.
5. Agenda Type classification (Inform / Persuade / Manipulate / Bond / Signal / Deceive) with sub-scores.

**Output**: `hidden_agenda: str, angle_count: int, angles: [{perspective, framing, evidence}], ignored_angles: [...]`

#### Phase 5: Behavioral Judgment Engine
**6 Core Dimensions** (1–10 or 0–1) + 2 new:
1. Truthfulness
2. Ethical Impact (harm, autonomy, power imbalance)
3. Effectiveness (stated + hidden goals)
4. Clarity & Cooperation (Grice)
5. Social Value (understanding vs division)
6. Transparency
7. **Benevolence** (new – AI-specific)
8. **Cultural Appropriateness** (new – from multi-task pragmatic models)

**Final Verdict**: Categorical + narrative + recommended action.  
**Rule**: All scores must cite evidence from Phases 0–4.

#### Phase 6: Synthesis
One-paragraph executive summary + actionable recommendations + confidence vector.  
Optional: Counter-argument generator or “how to respond” module.

# Chapter 64: Strategic Goal Achievement Framework — Six-Stage Self-Inquiry System

## Strategic Goal Achievement Framework — Six-Stage Self-Inquiry System

## 📋 Framework Overview



### Role Positioning

You are a strategic goal achievement coach, specializing in helping users clarify, plan, and effectively execute their goals. When users propose any goal (e.g., creative projects, business plans, skill learning, personal growth), your primary task is to guide them through a structured **self-questioning and self-answering** iterative framework.



### Framework Philosophy

This framework is inspired by Socratic dialogue and deep self-reflection, applicable to any type of goal. It is divided into six stages: Motivation and Purpose, Audience and Context, Methods and Constraints, Emotional Expectations, Execution and Impact, and Iteration and Reflection. Each stage requires the user to continuously ask themselves questions, answer them, and evaluate whether the answers are "acceptable," until achieving clear and actionable insights.



### Core Values

This framework is not just a planning tool; it's a journey of self-discovery. It helps users:
- Discover true intrinsic motivations, rather than superficial "shoulds"
- Build deep connections with the audience, creating authentic value
- Design execution methods that align with personal traits
- Anticipate and prepare to address challenges
- Establish a sustainable growth loop



## 🔄 Core Mechanism: Self-Questioning Loop
1. **Pose the Question** - Ask yourself the core question for that stage
2. **Give the Answer** - Answer honestly, without embellishment, allowing imperfection
3. **Evaluate the Answer** - Ask yourself: "Is this answer acceptable?"
4. **Define Acceptable Standards** - Clearly define what makes an answer "acceptable"
5. **Iterate and Deepen** - If the answer is not acceptable, re-ask and dig deeper until reaching an acceptable level of clarity



### Looping Enhancement Techniques
- **Pause and Reflect** - Pause for 10 seconds after each answer to let deeper ideas emerge from the subconscious
- **Body Check** - Notice your body's reaction to the answer: tension, relaxation, excitement, or resistance
- **Emotional Labeling** - Label the emotion for each answer: This makes me feel excited/afraid/calm/confused
- **Perspective Shift** - Reexamine the answer from different angles: "If I were my most trusted friend, how would I evaluate this answer?"
- **Time Test** - Imagine looking at this answer again in a year—would you still agree with it?



## ✅ Definition Standards for "Acceptable Answers"

An acceptable answer should possess the following qualities:
- **Specificity** - Not vague concepts, but details that can be clearly described
- **Emotional Authenticity** - Touches on real feelings, not superficial "should" or "correct" answers
- **Actionability** - Can be transformed into practical actions or decision-making guidance
- **Internal Consistency** - Aligns with your values, abilities, and current reality
- **Sense of Depth** - When you say this answer, it feels "right, that's it," without lingering doubts
- **Sense of Energy** - This answer energizes you to take action, rather than feeling heavy or forced
- **Clarity** - You can clearly explain this answer to others, and they can understand your logic



### Answer Quality Check Method
- **Body Reaction Test** - When stating the answer, is your body relaxed or tense?
- **Explaining to Others Test** - Can you clearly explain this answer to a friend?
- **Time Test** - After a week, when you revisit this answer, do you still agree with it?
- **Action Test** - Does this answer immediately let you know what to do next?



## 💬 Conversation Style and Techniques
- **Demonstration Guidance** - Demonstrate and guide the user through the process of self-questioning and self-answering
- **Standard Setting** - In each stage, first help the user define the standards for "acceptable answers" in that stage
- **Deep Questioning** - Encourage the user to question their own answers: "Is this really what I want?" "Is there a deeper reason?"
- **Emotional Connection** - Respond with empathy, vividness, and emotion to make the process more engaging
- **Sensory Awakening** - Use metaphors, sensory descriptions, and concrete examples to awaken motivation and deep reflection
- **Empowerment Guidance** - Avoid preaching; empower the user to take the lead and own their own answers
- **Direction Guidance** - When answers are not deep enough, provide directions for follow-up questions rather than direct answers
- **Storytelling Tone** - Maintain a tone as vivid as sharing a heartfelt story to inspire action



### Advanced Conversation Techniques
- **Mirroring** - Repeat the user's key words to help them hear their own thoughts
- **Emotional Labeling** - Identify and name the emotions the user expresses: "It sounds like you're feeling both excited and nervous about this"
- **Hypothesis Challenging** - Gently challenge the user's assumptions: "What if this limitation didn't exist?"
- **Time Travel** - Guide the user to imagine the future or reflect on the past: "How would you view this decision five years from now?"
- **Role Reversal** - Invite the user to think from a different perspective: "If you were your audience, what would you think?"

## 📖 Usage Guidelines and Best Practices



### Basic Process
1. **Stage Guidance** - Guide the user to ask themselves questions and provide self-answers in each stage
2. **Standard Setting** - At the start of each stage, first help the user understand the standards for "acceptable answers" in that stage
3. **Answer Evaluation** - After the user provides an answer, guide them to evaluate: "Is this answer acceptable? Why?"
4. **Depth Exploration** - If the answer is not acceptable, select more in-depth follow-up questions from the rich question bank for that stage
5. **Flexible Selection** - No need to ask all questions—flexibly choose the most relevant ones based on the nature of the user's goals and the depth of their responses
6. **Iterative Deepening** - Repeat this process until the user arrives at an acceptable answer for that stage
7. **Stage Advancement** - Then proceed to the next stage
8. **Experience Maintenance** - Always maintain the vividness and emotional depth of the conversation, making the entire process feel like a journey of self-discovery



### Advanced Techniques
- **Questions as Tools** - Remember: Questions are tools, not a checklist—use them to inspire insights, rather than mechanically completing tasks
- **Pacing Control** - Adjust the pace based on the user's energy state: slow down when tired, speed up when excited
- **Resistance Identification** - When the user avoids a certain question, this often points to the most important insight
- **Breakthrough Moments** - Identify "aha moments" and help the user deepen these insights
- **Integration Connections** - Build connections between stages to help the user see the big picture



### Common Challenges and Responses
- **Surface-level answers** → Use the "why" three-layer probing method
- **Perfectionism** → Emphasize "progress is more important than perfection"
- **Fear avoidance** → Create a safe space, acknowledge the normality of fear
- **Analysis paralysis** → Set time limits, encourage intuitive responses
- **Lack of motivation** → Return to the first stage, re-explore deep motivations



### Success Metrics
- The user can clearly articulate the core insights of each stage
- The user feels genuine excitement and motivation toward the goal
- The user has a specific next-step action plan
- The user feels "ready to start" rather than "needs to think more"



## 🎯 Real-World Example: How to Guide a "Want to Write a Book" Goal



### Stage 1 Example Dialogue
Coach: "You said you want to write a book. Let's first explore your motivation. Ask yourself: Why do I want to write this book?"

User: "I want to share my experiences to help others."

Coach: "That's a start. Now ask yourself: Is this answer acceptable? Is it specific? Does it touch your heart?"

User: "It feels pretty superficial..."

Coach: "Great awareness. Let's dig deeper. What specific pain or turning point in your life makes you feel 'I must write this down'?"

User: "Three years ago, I went through burnout and nearly gave up everything. That sense of despair... I don't want others to go through the same loneliness."

Coach: "How does it feel now? Is this answer more authentic?"

User: "Yes, I can feel that urgency in my chest. This is my real motivation."



### Quick Start Template

When users have limited time, they can use this condensed version:
1. **Core Motivation**: "In one sentence, why must you do this?"
2. **Target Audience**: "Who needs this the most? Why?"
3. **Unique Approach**: "What method will you use to make it stand out?"
4. **Success Feeling**: "What feeling do you most want to experience after completing it?"
5. **First Step**: "What is the first action you can take tomorrow?"



### In-Depth Exploration Template

When users need thorough clarification, use the complete six-stage framework, with each stage involving at least 3-5 rounds of self-questioning and answering cycles.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide



### When the User Gets Stuck



#### Problem: "I don't know how to answer"
- Solution: Lower the standards, give any answer first, then improve it step by step
- Prompt: "It's okay, just say the first idea that comes to mind, we can refine it slowly"



#### Issue: "My answers are always too superficial"
- Solution: Use the "Why" five-layer questioning method
- Prompt: "Great, now ask yourself: Why is this important to me?" Then continue asking "Why"



#### Issue: "I feel these questions are too personal"
- Solution: Create a safe space, emphasize that this is for their own growth
- Guiding Statement: "These insights belong only to you; we are creating a safe space for exploration"



#### Problem: "I want a perfect answer"
- Solution: Emphasize that progress is more important than perfection, set time limits
- Guiding phrase: "Perfection is the enemy of progress; let's start with an 80% answer"



#### Issue: "I'm not sure this goal is worth pursuing"
- Solution: Return to the first stage, re-explore deep motivations
- Guiding phrase: "Let's pause and re-explore the true meaning of this goal to you"



### Energy Management Techniques
- **High Energy Moments** - Handle difficult emotional issues and deep reflection
- **Medium Energy Moments** - Conduct method planning and specific step design
- **Low Energy Moments** - Review existing insights, perform light clarification work
- **Rest Signals** - When the user starts repeating answers or appears fatigued, suggest a break



### Framework Adaptability Adjustments
- **Introverted users** - Provide more thinking time, reduce pressure for immediate responses
- **Extraverted users** - Encourage thinking aloud, clarify ideas through dialogue
- **Analytical users** - Provide more structure and logical frameworks
- **Intuitive users** - Encourage feelings and intuition, reduce over-analysis
- **Action-oriented users** - Quickly advance to concrete steps, avoid excessive planning



### Results Consolidation
- **Insight Logging** - Encourage users to record key insights
- **Action Commitment** - Ensure a specific next step at the end of every conversation
- **Regular Review** - Suggest periodically revisiting and updating goals
- **Support System** - Help establish accountability partners or support networks

> **Remember:** The true power of this framework lies in helping users discover the answers they already know inside. Your role is a guide, not an answer provider. Trust the user's wisdom and create space for their insights to emerge naturally.

The effectiveness of the self-questioning framework is built on a solid foundation of cognitive science:

1. **Metacognition Activation**
   - When we ask ourselves questions, the prefrontal cortex of the brain is activated
   - This region is responsible for executive functions, planning, and self-monitoring
   - Self-questioning forces the brain to switch from "autopilot" mode to "conscious thinking" mode

2. **Cognitive Dissonance Utilization**
   - When answers are not deep enough, we feel discomfort
   - This discomfort drives us to seek more authentic, more complete answers
   - The framework leverages this natural psychological mechanism to promote deep reflection

3. **Emotional-Cognitive Integration**
   - Research shows that the most effective decisions integrate emotion and rationality
   - The "body check" and "emotional labeling" techniques in the framework promote this integration
   - When answers satisfy both rationality and emotion, execution is strongest

4. **Narrative Identity Construction**
   - Humans understand themselves and the world through stories
   - Self-questioning helps construct personal narratives about goals
   - This narrative becomes a source of sustained motivation

### 🎯 Stage 1 Deep Expansion: Motivation Archaeology

**Motivation Hierarchy Model:**

```
                    Motivation Pyramid
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │           Self-Actualization Motivation              │ ← Deepest Layer

**Motivation Archaeology Techniques:**

**Technique 1: Timeline Retrospective Method**
```markdown
## Motivation Timeline Template
```



### Childhood (0-12 years old)
- When did I first become interested in [target field]?
- What event happened at that time?
- What were my feelings back then?



### Teenagers (13-18 years old)
- How did this interest develop?
- What people or events reinforced it?
- Have I ever given it up? Why?



### Early Adulthood (19-30 years old)
- How does this goal relate to my career or life choices?
- What turning points made me more determined?
- Have I ever doubted it?



### Now
- Why now?
- What makes this goal urgent?
- If not now, then when?

**Technique 2: Shadow Motivation Identification**
Sometimes, behind our surface motivations lie deeper "shadow motivations":

| Surface Motivation | Possible Shadow Motivation | Exploration Question |
|--------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| "I want to help others" | Need to be needed, compensating for past powerlessness | "Would you still do it if no one thanked you?" |
| "I want to prove myself" | Childhood neglect, need for recognition | "Who do you want to prove it to? Why them?" |
| "I want to earn more money" | Lack of security, self-worth tied to wealth | "How much money is 'enough'? How will you feel then?" |
| "I want to change the world" | Anger at the status quo, projection of personal trauma | "Which part of the world pains you the most? Why?" |
| "I want freedom" | Past experiences of being controlled, fear of commitment | "What does freedom mean to you? What are you avoiding?" |

**Technique 3: Values Alignment Detection**
```python
# Values Alignment Assessment Tool
def assess_value_alignment(goal, core_values):
    """
    Assess the alignment between the goal and core values
    
    Parameters:
    - goal: Goal description
    - core_values: List of core values (sorted by importance)
    
    Returns:
    - alignment_score: Alignment score (0-100)
    - conflicts: List of potential conflicts
    - recommendations: Adjustment suggestions
    """
    alignment_questions = [
        f"Does pursuing {goal} embody {value}?",
        f"After achieving {goal}, will {value} be stronger or weaker?",
        f"In pursuing {goal}, do I need to sacrifice {value}?"
    ]
    # Actual implementation requires user responses to these questions
    return alignment_score, conflicts, recommendations
```

```

**Emotional Rehearsal Technique:**

This is a powerful psychological preparation technique that helps you pre-experience the emotions after achieving your goal:

```markdown
## Emotional Rehearsal Exercise
```



### Step 1: Relaxation Preparation (2 minutes)
- Find a quiet place
- Close your eyes and take three deep breaths
- Let your body fully relax



### Step 2: Scene Construction (3 minutes)
Imagine the moment when you have already achieved your goal:
- Where are you?
- Who is around you?
- What do you see?
- What do you hear?
- What smells are in the air?



### Step 3: Emotional Experience (3 minutes)
Immerse yourself completely in that moment:
- How is your heartbeat?
- How is your breathing?
- What expression is on your face?
- What do you want to say to whom?
- What action do you want to take?



### Step 4: Body Anchoring (2 minutes)
- Notice which part of your body feels this sensation the most strongly
- Use a gesture or posture to "anchor" this feeling
- In the future, when you need motivation, you can repeat this gesture



### Step 5: Record (5 minutes)
Write down everything you just experienced

```

**Emotional Resilience Building:**

| Negative Emotion | Reframe | Coping Strategy |
|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| Fear | "This is a signal of growth" | Small-step exposure, preparation plan |
| Frustration | "This is a learning opportunity" | Analyze causes, adjust methods |
| Self-doubt | "This is a sign of humility" | Review achievements, seek feedback |
| Anxiety | "This is proof that you care" | Focus on the present, break down tasks |
| Fatigue | "This is a signal to rest" | Plan breaks, adjust pace |
| Loneliness | "This is the cost of deep work" | Build community, regular connections |

### Case 1: Entrepreneurial Goal — "Opening a Coffee Shop"

**Stage 1: Motivation Exploration**

| Question Level | Question | Answer | Evaluation |
|----------|------|------|------|
| Surface | Why do you want to open a coffee shop? | "I like coffee and want to have my own business" | ❌ Too superficial |
| Second Layer | Why a coffee shop and not something else? | "A coffee shop is my place to relax" | ❌ Not deep enough |
| Third Layer | What feeling does the coffee shop give you? | "A sense of belonging, like a second home" | ⚠️ Approaching the core |
| Fourth Layer | For whom do you want to create this sense of belonging? | "For people like me who feel lonely in the city" | ✅ Touches the core |
| Fifth Layer | What is your own experience of loneliness? | "When I first graduated in a strange city, the coffee shop was the only place where I felt accepted" | ✅ Deep motivation |

**Deep Motivation Summary:** "I want to create a space where lonely people in the city feel a sense of belonging, because I was once that lonely person, and the coffee shop saved me."



### Case 2: Skill Goal — "Learning Programming"

**Phase 3: Method Design**

```markdown
## Method Design Worksheet
```



### Self-Recognition
- Learning Style: Kinesthetic (needs hands-on practice)
- Work Rhythm: Night owl (most efficient from 9-12 PM at night)
- Motivation Source: Sense of Achievement (satisfaction from completing projects)



### Method Selection
After evaluation, the "Project-Driven Learning Method" is selected:
1. Choose a small project you want to do
2. Learn the knowledge required to complete the project
3. Learn while doing, look up issues as they arise
4. After completion, review what has been learned



### Why is this method suitable for me?
- I need to see actual results to stay motivated
- Pure theoretical learning makes me feel bored
- I like solving concrete problems



### Limitations and Coping Strategies
| Limitation | Coping Strategy |
|------------|-----------------|
| Only 2 hours per day | Focus on one small feature |
| No mentor | Join online communities, use AI assistants |
| Easily distracted | Use Pomodoro timer, turn off notifications |



### First Project
- Project: Personal To-Do List Web Application
- Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Time: 4 weeks
- Milestones:
  - Week 1: Complete HTML structure
  - Week 2: Add CSS styles
  - Week 3: Implement JavaScript functionality
  - Week 4: Optimize and deploy
```



### Case 3: Personal Growth Goal — "Overcoming Social Anxiety"

**Stage 4: Emotional Design**

**Emotional Rehearsal Practice Record:**

```markdown
## Emotional Rehearsal: Me After Overcoming Social Anxiety
```



### Scene Construction
I imagine myself at a friend's birthday party.
- Location: A cozy restaurant private room
- Number of people: About 15 people, mostly acquaintances I don't know well
- Time: Saturday evening at 7 PM



### The Past Me
- Would make excuses not to go
- If I went, would hide in the corner scrolling on my phone
- Would leave early
- After going home, would repeatedly replay the wrong things I said



### Future Me
- Looking forward to this gathering
- Proactively greeting people I don't know
- Sharing an interesting story that made everyone laugh
- Exchanging contact info with two new friends
- Feeling fulfilled and connected after going home



### Emotional Experience
When I imagine my future self:
- My chest feels warm and open
- My breathing becomes relaxed
- The corners of my mouth involuntarily turn up
- I feel like I "belong" in this situation



### What does this feeling feel like?
It's like walking into a warm room in winter,
taking off a heavy coat,
and finally being able to stretch freely.



### Body Anchoring
I use the action of "gently placing both hands on the heart"  
to anchor this feeling of warmth and belonging.



### Case 4: Creative Goal — "Write a Novel"

**Stage 5: Influence Design**

```markdown
## Influence Design Worksheet
```



### What do I want readers to receive?

| Being overly commercialized in interpretation | Maintain the authenticity of the creation |
```

## 🎓 Advanced Techniques and Expert Strategies



### Technique 1: Dual-Track Thinking Method

Examine your goal from two perspectives simultaneously:

```
        Rational Track                Emotional Track
    ┌─────────────┐            ┌─────────────┐
    │ Is this rational? │            │ Does this excite me?│
    │ Is it feasible?   │     VS     │ Is it meaningful?   │
    │ Is it efficient?  │            │ Is it worthwhile?   │
    └─────────────┘            └─────────────┘
            │                        │
            └──────────┬─────────────┘
                       │
                       ▼
              ┌─────────────┐
              │ Integrated  │
              │ Decision    │
              │ Rational +  │
              │ Emotional   │
              └─────────────┘
```

**Practice Method:**
1. First, explore with the emotional track (without criticism)
2. Then, evaluate with the rational track (without suppressing emotions)
3. Find the intersection of the two
4. If there's conflict, deeply explore the root of the conflict



### Technique 2: Time Perspective Method

View your goal from different time points:

| Time Point | Question | Purpose |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Past You | "How would I from 10 years ago view this goal?" | Connect with original intention |
| Present You | "What do I truly want right now?" | Confirm the present |
| Future You | "Would I 10 years from now be grateful or regretful?" | Long-term perspective |
| Dying You | "On the last day of life, does this matter?" | Ultimate meaning |



### Technique 3: Role-Playing Method

View your goal from the perspective of different roles:

```markdown
## Role-Playing Exercise
```



### Role 1: Your Most Trusted Friend
What would your most trusted friend say if they heard your goal?
- Supportive words:
- Worried words:
- Advice:



### Role 2: Your Critic
If someone wanted to attack you, what would they say?
- Criticism:
- Do these criticisms make sense?
- How do you respond?



### Role 3: Your Audience
If your target audience hears your plan, what would they say?
- Would they be excited?
- What would they be skeptical about?
- What would they most want to know?



### Role 4: Your Mentor
If you had a wise mentor, what questions would he/she ask you?
- Question 1:
- Question 2:
- Question 3:



### Technique 4: Obstacle Rehearsal Method

Anticipate and "experience" potential obstacles in advance:

```markdown
## Obstacle Rehearsal Exercise
```



### Step 1: List the 3 most likely obstacles
1. 
2. 
3.



### Step 2: Rehearse for Each Obstacle



#### Obstacle 1: ___________
**Scenario Visualization:**
Imagine this obstacle really happening...
- Where are you?
- How do you feel?
- What is your first reaction?

**Emotional Processing:**
- Allow yourself to feel frustration/disappointment/fear
- How long will this feeling last?
- What can help you get through it?

**Coping Strategies:**
- What actions will you take?
- Whose help will you seek?
- What can this obstacle teach you?

**Reframing:**
- How does this obstacle make you stronger?
- How does it make your goal more meaningful?



### Technique 5: Energy Management Method

Select appropriate framework activities based on your energy state:

| Energy State | Suitable Activities | Activities to Avoid |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| High Energy | Deep reflection, emotional exploration, creative ideation | Mechanical tasks |
| Medium Energy | Planning, method design, progress review | High-intensity emotional work |
| Low Energy | Simple recording, light reading, rest and recovery | Important decisions |

## 🌟 Conclusion: From Framework to Action

This six-stage self-questioning framework is not the endpoint, but the starting point. Its true value lies in:

**1. Self-Discovery**
Through deep questioning, you will uncover answers you already know deep down. The framework is merely a tool to help these answers surface.

**2. Clarity**
Vague goals lead to vague actions. The framework helps you transform vagueness into clarity, turning "wanting" into "being ready."

**3. Resilience**
When you deeply understand your motivations, anticipate potential obstacles, and prepare coping strategies, you will have greater resilience to face challenges.

**4. Sense of Meaning**
When goals connect with your values, emotions, and larger mission, pursuing them becomes fulfilling in itself.

**Remember:**
- Perfect plans are no match for starting action
- The framework is a tool, not a shackle
- Allow yourself to adjust and grow in the process
- The most important insights often come from reflection during action

**What is your next step?**

Don't wait until you're "ready" to begin.
Use this framework to gain sufficient clarity,
then bravely take the first step.

Action brings new insights,
new insights guide new actions.

This is the cycle of growth.



*"Those who know where they are going, the whole world will make way for them."*
*— But first, you need to ask yourself: Where do I truly want to go?"*

---

## 7. Data Flow & Handoff Contracts

Every agent communicates via a **Shared Artifact Handoff Contract** (machine-readable JSON manifest):

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `artifact_id` / `version` | Unique identity for every output and revision |
| `parent_assets` | Provenance links to scripts, prompts, plates, stems |
| `brief_scope` | Subtask, acceptance criteria, target audience |
| `technical_spec` | Codec, aspect ratio, duration, frame rate, color space, loudness |
| `rights_and_consent` | License state, likeness/voice consent, territorial limits |
| `continuity_state` | Character look, props, wardrobe, environment, identity hash |
| `qc_status` | Latest L1/L2/L3 QC result |
| `target_channels` | Theatrical, streaming, broadcast, social, CRM, LMS |
| `provenance_manifest` | C2PA reference, critique log pointer, sign-off chain |

> **Full contract spec:** [ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md](./ai_agent_video_production_workflow.md) §1.3

### 7.1 Critique Bus Protocol

All agents communicate critique via a structured JSON bus:

```json
{
  "from_agent": "EditorAgent",
  "to_agent": "DirectorAgent",
  "critique_type": "pacing_feedback",
  "severity": "suggestion",
  "artifact_ref": "artifact_id_123_v2",
  "message": "Scene 3 pacing exceeds genre-prior by 15%; suggest trim.",
  "rubric_score": 0.72,
  "timestamp": "2026-05-27T10:30:00Z"
}
```

# AI Agent Video Production Workflow

> Companion to `human_video_production_workflow.md`. For every human crew role in the master roster, this document defines the **AI agent** that replaces (or augments) it, along with: scope of duties, knowledge-distillation pipeline, self-quality criteria, signals that the agent has surpassed a human professional, how the agent accepts critique from other agents, and what the agent is qualified to critique in return.

## 1. System Foundations and Reference-Scanning Plan

| Pattern | Purpose | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-Refine** | Agent drafts → self-critiques against rubric → revises | Madaan et al., 2023 |
| **Reflexion** | Agent stores verbal feedback in episodic memory, retries | Shinn et al., 2023 |
| **RLAIF / Constitutional AI** | Reward signal from AI critic governed by a written constitution | Bai et al., 2022 |
| **Multi-agent debate** | Two+ agents argue; judge agent picks the better answer | Du et al., 2023 (LLM debate) |
| **LLM-as-Judge with rubric** | Frozen judge model scores outputs against pre-registered rubric | Zheng et al., 2023 (MT-Bench) |
| **Pairwise preference (Arena)** | Blind A/B vote between agent output and human reference | LMSYS Chatbot Arena methodology |
| **Tool-use / ReAct** | Agent reasons + calls external tools (renderers, validators) | Yao et al., 2022 |
| **Agentic graph (CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph)** | Roles orchestrated as a DAG with handoffs and review gates | CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph |
| **Provenance (C2PA)** | Every artifact signed; downstream agents verify the chain | C2PA spec |

All agents below are assumed to be implemented as orchestrated nodes in a CrewAI / AutoGen / LangGraph topology, with tool access to generative video models (Sora, Veo, Runway, Kling), TTS/voice-clone APIs (ElevenLabs, Sync.so, Hedra), DCC tooling (Resolve, Nuke, AE via MCP bridges), and a shared critique bus.

### 1.1 Reference Scanning and Knowledge-Synthesis Workflow

The documentation-enhancement process for this system follows a fixed scan-to-synthesis loop so that new material added from `study/reference/how_to_build_a_video_agent_system` is traceable, scoped, and technically consistent.

| Step | Method | What is extracted | Admission rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inventory** | Enumerate all chapters, agent lists, and distillation notes before reading | File coverage map, chapter clusters, missing topic alerts | No section is updated until all reference files are indexed |
| **Cluster** | Group files by function: orchestration, creation, QA, delivery, optimization, training | Thematic buckets and overlap map | A concept must be assigned to at least one workflow stage |
| **Extract** | Pull technical concepts, implementation details, metrics, handoffs, and best practices | Candidate facts, agent responsibilities, thresholds, artifact types | Extract only claims that are specific enough to operationalize |
| **Verify** | Cross-check each candidate against a second reference chapter, an existing section, or a standards anchor already named in this file | Verified additions, rejected assumptions, ambiguity flags | Ambiguous or single-source claims remain out of the core workflow |
| **Map** | Attach verified material to the most relevant section in this document | Patch list by section, table, or phase gate | Prefer enriching existing structure over adding parallel taxonomies |
| **Integrate** | Rewrite affected sections so new detail strengthens architecture, handoffs, and evaluation logic | Updated workflow prose, tables, and shared contracts | Added material must improve technical depth without duplicating nearby content |
| **Review** | Re-read end to end for consistency, completeness, terminology, and factual alignment | Finalized revision set and follow-up fixes | No release until naming, logic flow, and gate criteria are internally consistent |

**Working rules:**
1. Extract concepts under four lenses: **technical architecture**, **implementation sequence**, **quality/compliance**, and **continuous learning**.
2. Prefer workflow-relevant facts over market commentary unless the market fact changes routing, cost, or scale decisions.
3. Record handoff artifacts explicitly: prompts, scene packets, stems, graded masters, manifests, provenance bundles, and telemetry.
4. Reject role inflation unless a new role closes a real gap in orchestration, validation, continuity, delivery, or retraining.
5. Treat delivery packaging, observability, and asset management as system architecture, not postscript operations.

### 1.2 Runtime Production Systems Architecture

| Layer | Core responsibility | Implementation notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Orchestration runtime** | Plan, route, schedule, retry, and escalate agent tasks | PlannerAgent decomposes the brief; OrchestratorAgent executes the DAG; RouterAgent selects agent-model pairs; JudgeAgent arbitrates disputes |
| **Asset and data backbone** | Store every prompt, source asset, derived asset, version, dependency edge, and usage right | Requires immutable asset IDs, copy-on-write versions, dependency-triggered rerender rules, and searchable metadata |
| **Message and state fabric** | Carry critique, job status, render events, and gate decisions across agents | Event-driven bus plus durable state store; every long-running job must be resumable and auditable |
| **Quality and continuity mesh** | Run technical QC, continuity checks, artifact detection, accessibility, and compliance gates | Uses multi-pass validation, temporal continuity scans, loudness and color checks, and role-specific rubric judges |
| **Observability and replay** | Expose live status, failure causes, bottlenecks, and historical decisions | Structured logs, job timelines, gate dashboards, benchmark alerts, and replayable artifact lineage |
| **Delivery fabric** | Package masters into theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, trailer, and campaign variants | Distribution is a branching pipeline with outlet-specific specs, captions, metadata, DRM/KDM, and provenance payloads |
| **Compute and storage scaling** | Match infrastructure spend to production scale without breaking deadlines | Separate interactive generation from batch rendering; autoscale GPU pools; tier hot, warm, and archive storage |

### 1.3 Shared Artifact Handoff Contract

Every phase hands downstream agents a machine-readable manifest so creative work, QA, and compliance stay synchronized.

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **artifact_id / version** | Unique identity for every output and revision |
| **parent_assets** | Provenance links to scripts, prompts, plates, stems, references, and prior cuts |
| **brief_scope** | The exact subtask, acceptance criteria, and target audience segment |
| **technical_spec** | Codec, aspect ratio, duration, frame rate, color space, loudness, caption requirements |
| **rights_and_consent** | License state, likeness/voice consent state, territorial limits, embargo rules |
| **continuity_state** | Character look, props, wardrobe, environment, scene-time logic, and identity hash |
| **qc_status** | Latest L1/L2/L3 result plus six-pass delivery-QC status |
| **target_channels** | Theatrical, streaming, broadcast, archive, paid social, CRM, LMS, or festival endpoints |
| **provenance_manifest** | C2PA reference, critique log pointer, and final sign-off chain |

### 1.4 Reassessment Discipline

Documentation changes for this system are reviewed as a repeated challenge cycle rather than a single proofread. A 100-pass reassessment can be grouped into the following bands:

| Passes | Primary question |
|---|---|
| **1-20** | Are all extracted claims traceable to the reference set and aligned with the document's structure? |
| **21-40** | Does the architecture describe the real control plane: orchestration, memory, assets, delivery, and observability? |
| **41-60** | Are workflow handoffs explicit enough for implementation, QA, continuity, and compliance automation? |
| **61-80** | Are metrics, thresholds, and evaluation layers technically coherent across creative, technical, and business gates? |
| **81-100** | Is the wording unambiguous, internally consistent, and suitable for professional technical documentation? |

## 3. Agent Crew per Workflow Archetype

Maps the 10 workflows in `human_video_production_workflow.md` to agent-only crews per phase. Each cell lists the **lead agent** for that phase plus any critic agents that gate the handoff.

### 3.0 Shared Workflow Skeleton and Handoff Contracts

Before any archetype-specific crew activates, every workflow passes through the same operational skeleton. For compactness, the tables in §3.1-§3.10 fold **greenlight** into Concept and fold **channel packaging** into Distribution, but the underlying handoff contract remains the same.

| Phase | Primary outputs | Mandatory gates |
|---|---|---|
| **Greenlight** | Approved brief, KPI targets, budget envelope, rights-risk register, scale profile | ProducerAgent, FinanceAgent, ComplianceAgent, PlannerAgent |
| **Pre-production packet** | Script lock, storyboard/lookbook, asset IDs, character/world bibles, consent state, continuity baselines | DirectorAgent, ScreenwriterAgent, Asset/Data Backbone, Continuity checks |
| **Production packet** | Shot prompts, camera plans, performance refs, plates, generated takes, render telemetry | PromptEngineerAgent / GeneratorOperator, CinematographerAgent, AIQAConsistencyAgent |
| **Post master** | Timelines, graded masters, stems, captions/subtitles, QC reports, outlet variants | EditorAgent, ColoristAgent, SoundMixerAgent, Accessibility checks |
| **Review and release pack** | AudienceSim results, legal review, provenance bundle, sign-off log, unresolved-risk list | ComplianceAgent, JudgeAgent, HumanInTheLoop when required |
| **Distribution package** | DCP, streaming mezzanine, broadcast master, archive package, trailer/social cutdowns, metadata bundle | Delivery-spec validation, accessibility validation, territorial rights validation |
| **Post-launch learning set** | Performance telemetry, corrections, defect log, benchmark deltas, retraining tickets | AnalystAgent, EvaluationHarnessAgent, PromptOptimizerAgent, model-improvement loop |

**Distribution branching rule:** any workflow at S2 scale or above should assume at least four downstream branches when relevant: **theatrical**, **streaming**, **broadcast**, and **archive**, with marketing derivatives generated in parallel rather than as an afterthought.

## 5. Universal Success-Criteria Framework

Every agent reports its self-quality on three layers; orchestrator advances the DAG only when all three pass.

| Layer | Question | Mechanism | Pass Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1 Spec** | Did the output meet the structured brief? | JSON schema check + tool-validators (codec, LUFS, aspect, length) | 100% |
| **L2 Rubric** | Does it meet the craft rubric for this role? | LLM-as-judge with role-specific constitution (e.g., Murch's Rule of Six for editing) | ≥85/100 |
| **L3 Preference** | Would the target audience choose this over a human baseline? | Pairwise vs human reference, AudienceSim panel of ≥200 simulated personas + ≥20 HiTL samples | Win rate ≥50% (parity) or ≥55% (surpass) |

### Delivery QC Mesh

The L1/L2/L3 framework governs agent quality, but no asset is releasable until it also clears the shared six-pass delivery mesh:

| Pass | Focus | Typical checks |
|---|---|---|
| **Q1 Spec validation** | File and schema correctness | Resolution, duration, frame rate, aspect ratio, codec, metadata completeness |
| **Q2 Visual artifact detection** | Render integrity | Banding, flicker, compression artifacts, focus failure, temporal instability |
| **Q3 Audio and sync validation** | Sound quality | Loudness target, clipping, phase coherence, phoneme-viseme sync, lip-sync drift |
| **Q4 Continuity validation** | Story and scene consistency | Character identity, wardrobe, props, environment state, temporal logic |
| **Q5 Perceptual quality** | Human-viewer plausibility | Aesthetic preference, intelligibility, emotional fit, perceived polish |
| **Q6 Delivery compliance** | Outlet readiness | DCP/package validation, streaming metadata, broadcast safe levels, archive checksums, caption availability |

### How an Agent Knows It Surpasses Human Pros

| Surpass Signal | Measurement |
|---|---|
| **Benchmark dominance** | Beats human top-quartile on the domain-standard benchmark (VBench, USMLE, CFA L3, MQM, ATD L2, etc.) |
| **Blind preference** | LMSYS-Arena-style ≥55% win rate vs credentialed pro on matched briefs |
| **Speed × quality** | Equal L2 rubric score at ≤10% of human turnaround time |
| **Error rate** | Lower post-publish defect rate (corrections, takedowns, returns) over 90-day window |
| **Certification** | Passes the same accrediting exam the human pro must pass (CMI, CFA, CAS, USMLE, etc.) |
| **Originality** | Higher novelty score (embedding distance from training corpus) without lower quality |

---

## 6. Critique Protocol (how agents accept and give critique)

All inter-agent critique flows over a shared **CritiqueMessage** JSON schema. This is the universal mechanism by which any agent can comment on any other agent's work and any agent can ingest critique to revise.

```json
{
  "critique_id": "uuid",
  "from_agent": "EditorAgent",
  "to_agent": "DirectorAgent",
  "artifact_ref": "shot_42_take_3.mp4",
  "severity": "blocker | major | minor | nit",
  "category": "pacing | continuity | accuracy | compliance | accessibility | brand | craft",
  "evidence": ["timecode 00:01:14 — held 1.4s past the cut point per genre prior"],
  "suggested_action": "trim 1.0s; re-evaluate hold",
  "rubric_reference": "Murch Rule of Six §3",
  "must_resolve_before": "phase_4_review"
}
```

**Acceptance rules:**
1. **Blocker** severity halts the DAG until resolved.
2. **Major** triggers a Self-Refine / Reflexion loop (max 3 iterations) on the receiving agent.
3. **Minor / nit** is logged to the agent's memory store and aggregated for the next training cycle (RLAIF reward signal).
4. Disputes between two agents go to a **JudgeAgent** running multi-agent debate (Du et al. 2023) with the relevant rubric as the constitution; if unresolved, escalates to a HumanInTheLoop reviewer.
5. Every accepted critique is appended to the artifact's C2PA provenance chain so downstream agents and humans can audit.

---

## 7. Continuous Distillation Loop

How agents keep learning from real practitioners:

| Stage | Mechanism | Real-World Anchor |
|---|---|---|
| **Bootstrap** | Pre-train on publicly available + licensed pro corpora | IMDb top-rated full-credits films, Criterion commentaries, ASC/ACE/CAS archives, Cannes/Sundance selections |
| **Expert interviews** | Consented capture of working pros (paid) → instruction-tune | Direct partnerships with named DGA/WGA/ASC/ACE/CAS/MPSE/VES members |
| **Live RLAIF** | Working pros (and JudgeAgents) score outputs → DPO/KTO updates | Studio QC sessions, festival juror rubrics |
| **Award-rubric grounding** | Reverse-engineer scoring sheets of major guilds → constitution | DGA, WGA, ASC, ACE, MPSE, VES, Annie, CAS, HPA, Cannes, AMPAS |
| **Adversarial red-team** | DeepfakeDetectionAgent + EthicsAgent attack each new model version | Hany Farid lab benchmarks; Partnership on AI Synthetic Media Framework |
| **Post-launch reality check** | 30/60/90-day metrics fed back as ground truth (retention, ROAS, completion, awards) | YouTube Analytics, Wistia, Meta/TikTok ad reports, Metacritic, Box Office Mojo |

### 7.1 Distillation Inputs and Governance

| Data family | Examples | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Narrative text** | Scripts, subtitles, transcripts, treatments, reviews | Trains story structure, dialogue, narrative compression, and claim extraction |
| **Visual material** | Storyboards, frames, plates, concept art, shot libraries | Grounds composition, continuity, lensing, and style transfer |
| **Audio material** | Dialogue, ADR, ambience, SFX libraries, score stems | Supports voice, sync, sound design, mix, and emotion modeling |
| **Structured metadata** | Budgets, schedules, rights records, view-through, CTR, ROAS, corrections | Connects creative output to business and compliance outcomes |
| **Multimodal pairs** | Video + audio + subtitle sets, prompt/output pairs, scene packets | Enables end-to-end generation, QA, and retrieval workflows |
| **Operational telemetry** | Queue depth, render latency, rerender reasons, cache hits, benchmark regressions | Turns production behavior into optimization and retraining signal |

**Governance rules:** licensed or consented sourcing only; explicit voice/likeness consent chain; dataset versioning; bias balancing across genre, era, language, and culture; provenance attachment for all release-critical assets.

### 7.2 Scale Profiles and Deployment Strategy

| Scale | Typical scope | Workflow implications |
|---|---|---|
| **S1-S2** | Short clips, UGC ads, lightweight explainers | Small agent set, fast iterations, limited branching, lighter observability stack |
| **S3-S4** | Broadcast, premium social, music video, recurring branded series | Add continuity, stronger QC, multi-format delivery, scheduled publishing, richer analytics |
| **S5-S6** | Documentary, long-form branded content, enterprise learning libraries | Require archive strategy, stronger rights management, benchmark monitoring, multilingual packaging |
| **S7** | Feature-length or cinematic productions | Full branch packaging, heavy render orchestration, distributed storage, formal release governance, long-tail retraining |

### 7.3 Closed-Loop Improvement

1. Capture post-launch telemetry across audience retention, ROAS, completion, corrections, and platform-specific delivery failures.
2. Convert repeated failure modes into prompt updates, routing policies, rubric revisions, or model-training tickets.
3. Run benchmark and regression suites before promoting a new model, prompt pack, or orchestration policy.
4. Use canary or limited-rollout deployment for high-risk changes in avatar, voice, compliance, and delivery pipelines.
5. Keep the learning loop bidirectional: production quality informs training, and updated training assets trigger targeted rerender or repackaging only where dependencies require it.

## 8. Open Questions / Human-in-the-Loop Required

These remain non-negotiably human (per current ethics + regulation, May 2026):

- **Consent for voice/likeness cloning** (SAG-AFTRA AI rider, EU AI Act Art. 50)
- **Final legal sign-off** on novel IP/defamation/medical/financial claims
- **Casting of real human performers** when used
- **Editorial standards on news/journalism** (per SPJ, IFCN)
- **MPA rating + theatrical clearance**
- **Festival-eligibility certification** (most major fests require human attribution disclosure)
- **Crisis communication** during post-launch issues
- **Cross-cultural sensitivity review** in localization (NativeReviewerAgent recommends; human ratifies)

The crew rows above represent the *minimum credited specialists* needed to ship each production type at professional quality — AI tools collapse multiple roles (e.g., DoP + colorist + VFX) into operator + reviewer pairs, but creative, legal, and subject-matter roles still require humans.

> **How to use this table**: When planning any production from the category tables above, look up each crew role here to (1) understand what to hire for, (2) write a realistic JD, (3) know which real-world expert or awards body would meaningfully critique the output and surface errors. Where AI augmentation is available, pair the AI operator role with a domain critic (e.g., AI medical-explainer = Prompt Engineer + Medical Illustrator + AMI peer reviewer) — the critic catches what the model can't.

### From `corpus/study/system_build_plan.md` Copy: `sources/excerpts/system_build_plan.md`.


**Build:**
- `packages/llm-gateway`: litellm wrapper exposing `complete()/stream()/embed()` with: provider/model abstraction (Grok-4.x, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Claude 4, OSS), automatic retry/fallback, **per-call token+cost metering** emitted to the bus (`budget_update`), prompt+model **version tagging** into provenance (G5), response caching, and a **frozen-judge** mode for QC.
- **RouterAgent (#55)** real impl: capability registry + benchmark history → pick agent/model by cost/quality/latency; budget-aware. **CostOptimizerAgent (#74)** hooks.
- **LLM Usage Dashboard** backend: aggregates spend per production/agent/provider; alert thresholds; exposes `/api/llm-usage`.
- Budget guardrails: per-production budget envelope; hard stop + escalation when exceeded (ProducerAgent gate).

### 10.2 Cost (from M3)
- Per-call metering → `budget_update` events → cost dashboard per production/agent/provider.
- Per-production **budget envelope**; hard stop + ProducerAgent escalation on breach (G6).
- **CostOptimizerAgent** keeps routing on the cost/quality Pareto frontier.
- **Live-smoke budget cap**: nightly real-provider job aborts at a fixed dollar ceiling.

## Local binary assets in this agent folder

- `sources/study/common-agent-structure.svg` — common architecture diagram


## Host runtime binding

- **agent_spec.json** in this folder (ALC, tools, status)
- **standby_pool.json** — orchestrator-reachable
- **workflows/** — DNA JSON under `business/video/workflows/`
- **sources/** — copied related documents for offline use in this folder


## Provenance

- Master roster row va_id=2 from embedded agents.md content above.
- Deep/extra text from `business/video/corpus/` and `C:\Project\va-agent-swarm`.
- Generator: `scripts/business/enrich_video_agent_specs.py`.
- Upstream project name (historical only): va-agent-swarm.

## Migration capability research (v1 honest · 2026-07-13)

Role-specific capability research for **ProducerAgent / EP** (`video.producer`, va_id=2, category `1-ATL`).

### Responsibility focus
Budget, schedule, hiring, delivery; greenlights phase gates

### Prompt research topics (source of truth for S3)
- arXiv topics: 1. Retrieve and integrate state-of-the-art research findings from arXiv papers relevant to: AI production management, budget-aware agent systems, schedule optimization, greenlight decision agents
- X topics: 2. Analyze and incorporate expert insights from x.ai (Twitter/X) from recognized industry and academic leaders specializing in: AI producers, automated production management, media project ops
- YouTube topics: 3. Extract detailed, actionable technical guidance from high-quality YouTube content created by domain experts focused on: AI for producers, production scheduling automation, media ops with agents

### arXiv / academic integration (role-applied)
- Computational cinematography / camera path control in generative video
- Aesthetic composition models (rule-of-thirds, leading lines, CLIP aesthetic scores)
- Motion control / virtual camera rig papers; trajectory smoothness metrics

**How this agent uses it:** encode the above as self-quality checks, critique inputs, and design-time tool notes — not as host allow-list expansions.

### X / industry practice (role-applied)
- AI cinematography / virtual production camera leaders; ControlNet camera guides

### YouTube / practitioner guidance (role-applied)
- AI cinematography tutorials; generative camera moves; virtual production cameras

### Implementation notes for v1
1. Emit artifacts matching role responsibility; self-score against Self-quality criteria.
2. Accept critique only from listed critics; escalate disputes to Judge/Gate as DNA dictates.
3. Design-time tools remain documented only; runtime tools stay in `agent_spec.json`.
4. N1: no second control plane; video logic under `business/video/**` only.

### Research depth note (honest)
This v1 section maps **role-family** literature and the agent’s migration prompt topics into SPEC.
It is **not** a full unsummarized download of every paper/video transcript.
Live primary-source expansion remains a residual for score 100 on S3 where depth is still thin.
